One or the other may get rolled back. Don’t assume that you can make a breaking change and it&amp;rsquo;ll be okay because the client and server are in sync.
Don&amp;rsquo;t Re-use a Tag Number Never re-use a tag number. It messes up deserialization. Even if you think no one is using the field, don’t re-use a tag number.</description></item><item><title>API Best Practices</title><link>https://protobuf.dev/best-practices/api/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protobuf.dev/best-practices/api/</guid><description>Updated for proto3. Patches welcome!
This doc is a complement to Proto Best Practices. It&amp;rsquo;s not a prescription for Java/C++/Go and other APIs.
If you see a proto straying from these guidelines in a code review, point the author to this topic and help spread the word.
Note These guidelines are just that and many have documented exceptions. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re writing a performance-critical backend, you might want to sacrifice flexibility or safety for speed.</description></item><item><title>1-1-1 Best Practice</title><link>https://protobuf.dev/best-practices/1-1-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protobuf.dev/best-practices/1-1-1/</guid><description>The 1-1-1 best practice is to keep every proto_library and .proto file as small as is reasonable, with the ideal being:
One proto_library build rule One source .proto file One top-level entity (message, enum, or extension) Having the fewest number of message, enum, extension, and services as you reasonably can makes refactoring easier. Moving files when they&amp;rsquo;re separated is much easier than extracting messages from a file with other messages.</description></item></channel></rss>
