Protobuf Editions replace the proto2 and proto3 designations that we have used
for Protocol Buffers. Instead of adding `syntax = "proto2"` or `syntax =
"proto3"` at the top of proto definition files, you use an edition number, such
as `edition = "2024"`, to specify the default behaviors your file will have.
Editions enable the language to evolve incrementally over time.

Instead of the hardcoded behaviors that older versions have had, editions
represent a collection of [features](/editions/features)
with a default value (behavior) per feature. Features are options on a file,
message, field, enum, and so on, that specify the behavior of protoc, the code
generators, and protobuf runtimes. You can explicitly override a behavior at
those different levels (file, message, field, ...) when your needs don't match
the default behavior for the edition you've selected. You can also override your
overrides. The [section later in this topic on lexical scoping](#scoping) goes
into more detail on that.

*The latest released edition is 2023.*

The examples in this topic show edition 2024 features, but edition 2024 is
currently in **pre-release review** and is not yet recommended for production
code.

## Lifecycle of a Feature {#lifecycles}

Editions provide the fundamental increments for the lifecycle of a feature.
Features have an expected lifecycle: introducing
it, changing its default behavior, deprecating it, and then removing it. For
example:

1.  Edition 2031 creates `feature.amazing_new_feature` with a default value of
    `false`. This value maintains the same behavior as all earlier editions.
    That is, it defaults to no impact. Not all new features will default to the
    no-op option, but for the sake of this example, `amazing_new_feature` does.

2.  Developers update their .proto files to `edition = "2031"`.

3.  A later edition, such as edition 2033, switches the default of
    `feature.amazing_new_feature` from `false` to `true`. This is the desired
    behavior for all protos, and the reason that the protobuf team created the
    feature.

    Using the Prototiller tool to migrate earlier versions of proto files to
    edition 2033 adds explicit `feature.amazing_new_feature = false` entries as
    needed to continue to retain the previous behavior. Developers remove these
    newly-added settings when they want the new behavior to apply to their
    .proto files.

<!-- mdformat off (preserve single lines/no wrapping) -->

4.  At some point, `feature.amazing_new_feature` is marked deprecated in an
    edition and removed in a later one.

    When a feature is removed, the code generators for that behavior and the
    runtime libraries that support it may also be removed. The timelines will be
    generous, though. Following the example in the earlier steps of the
    lifecycle, the deprecation might happen in edition 2034 but not be removed
    until edition 2036, roughly two years later. Removing a feature will always
    initiate a major version bump.

<!-- mdformat on -->

You will have the full
window of the Google migration plus the deprecation window to upgrade your code.

The preceding lifecycle example used boolean values for the features, but
features may also use enums. For example, `features.field_presence` has values
`LEGACY_REQUIRED`, `EXPLICIT`, and `IMPLICIT.`

## Migrating to Protobuf Editions {#migrating}

Editions won't break existing binaries and don't change a message's binary,
text, or JSON serialization format. Edition 2023 was as minimally disruptive as
possible. It established the baseline and combined proto2 and proto3 definitions
into a new single definition format.

As more editions are released, default behaviors for features may change. You
can have Prototiller do a no-op transformation of your .proto file or you can
choose to accept some or all of the new behaviors. Editions are planned to be
released roughly once a year.

### Proto2 to Editions {#proto2-migration}

This section shows a proto2 file, and what it might look like after running the
Prototiller tool to change the definition files to use Protobuf Editions syntax.

<section class="tabs">

#### Proto2 Syntax {.new-tab}

```proto
// proto2 file
syntax = "proto2";

package com.example;

message Player {
  // in proto2, optional fields have explicit presence
  optional string name = 1 [default = "N/A"];
  // proto2 still supports the problematic "required" field rule
  required int32 id = 2;
  // in proto2 this is not packed by default
  repeated int32 scores = 3;

  enum Handed {
    HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    HANDED_LEFT = 1;
    HANDED_RIGHT = 2;
    HANDED_AMBIDEXTROUS = 3;
  }

  // in proto2 enums are closed
  optional Handed handed = 4;

  reserved "gender";
}
```

#### Editions Syntax {.new-tab}

```proto
// Edition version of proto2 file
edition = "2024";

package com.example;

option features.utf8_validation = NONE;
option features.enforce_naming_style = STYLE_LEGACY;
option features.default_symbol_visibility = EXPORT_ALL;

// Sets the default behavior for C++ strings
option features.(pb.cpp).string_type = STRING;

message Player {
  // fields have explicit presence, so no explicit setting needed
  string name = 1 [default = "N/A"];
  // to match the proto2 behavior, LEGACY_REQUIRED is set at the field level
  int32 id = 2 [features.field_presence = LEGACY_REQUIRED];
  // to match the proto2 behavior, EXPANDED is set at the field level
  repeated int32 scores = 3 [features.repeated_field_encoding = EXPANDED];

  export enum Handed {
    // this overrides the default editions behavior, which is OPEN
    option features.enum_type = CLOSED;
    HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    HANDED_LEFT = 1;
    HANDED_RIGHT = 2;
    HANDED_AMBIDEXTROUS = 3;
  }

  Handed handed = 4;

  reserved gender;
}
```

### Proto3 to Editions {#proto3-migration}

This section shows a proto3 file, and what it might look like after running the
Prototiller tool to change the definition files to use Protobuf Editions syntax.

<section class="tabs">

#### Proto3 Syntax {.new-tab}

```proto
// proto3 file
syntax = "proto3";

package com.example;

message Player {
  // in proto3, optional fields have explicit presence
  optional string name = 1;
  // in proto3 no specified field rule defaults to implicit presence
  int32 id = 2;
  // in proto3 this is packed by default
  repeated int32 scores = 3;

  enum Handed {
    HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    HANDED_LEFT = 1;
    HANDED_RIGHT = 2;
    HANDED_AMBIDEXTROUS = 3;
  }

  // in proto3 enums are open
  optional Handed handed = 4;

  reserved "gender";
}
```

#### Editions Syntax {.new-tab}

```proto
// Editions version of proto3 file
edition = "2024";

package com.example;

option features.utf8_validation = NONE;
option features.enforce_naming_style = STYLE_LEGACY;
option features.default_symbol_visibility = EXPORT_ALL;

// Sets the default behavior for C++ strings
option features.(pb.cpp).string_type = STRING;

message Player {
  // fields have explicit presence, so no explicit setting needed
  string name = 1 [default = "N/A"];
  // to match the proto3 behavior, IMPLICIT is set at the field level
  int32 id = 2 [features.field_presence = IMPLICIT];
  // PACKED is the default state, and is provided just for illustration
  repeated int32 scores = 3 [features.repeated_field_encoding = PACKED];

  export enum Handed {
    HANDED_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    HANDED_LEFT = 1;

  reserved gender;
}
```

### Lexical Scoping {#scoping}

Editions syntax supports lexical scoping, with a per-feature list of allowed
targets. For example, in Edition 2023, features can be specified at only the
file level or the lowest level of granularity. The implementation of lexical
scoping enables you to set the default behavior for a feature across an entire
file, and then override that behavior at the message, field, enum, enum value,
oneof, service, or method level. Settings made at a higher level (file, message)
apply when no setting is made within the same scope (field, enum value). Any
features not explicitly set conform to the behavior defined in the edition
version used for the .proto file.

The following code sample shows some features being set at the file, field, and
enum level.

```proto {highlight="lines:3,7,16"}
edition = "2024";

option features.enum_type = CLOSED;

message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2 [features.field_presence = IMPLICIT];

  enum Pay_Type {
    PAY_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED = 1;
    PAY_TYPE_SALARY = 2;
    PAY_TYPE_HOURLY = 3;
  }

  enum Employment {
    option features.enum_type = OPEN;
    EMPLOYMENT_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    EMPLOYMENT_FULLTIME = 1;
    EMPLOYMENT_PARTTIME = 2;
  }
  Employment employment = 4;
}
```

In the preceding example, the presence feature is set to `IMPLICIT`; it would
default to `EXPLICIT` if it wasn't set. The `Pay_Type` `enum` will be `CLOSED`,
as it applies the file-level setting. The `Employment` `enum`, though, will be
`OPEN`, as it is set within the enum.

### Prototiller {#prototiller}

When the Prototiller tool is launched, we will
provide both a migration guide and migration tooling to ease the migration to
and between editions. The tool will enable you to:

*   convert proto2 and proto3 definition files to the new editions syntax, at
    scale
*   migrate files from one edition to another
*   manipulate proto files in other ways

### Backward Compatibility {#compatibility}

We are building Protobuf Editions to be as minimally disruptive as possible. For
example, you can import proto2 and proto3 definitions into editions-based
definition files, and vice versa:

```proto
// file myproject/foo.proto
syntax = "proto2";

enum Employment {
  EMPLOYMENT_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  EMPLOYMENT_FULLTIME = 1;
  EMPLOYMENT_PARTTIME = 2;
}
```

```proto
// file myproject/edition.proto
edition = "2024";

import "myproject/foo.proto";
```

While the generated code changes when you move from proto2 or proto3 to
editions, the wire format does not. You'll still be able to access proto2 and
proto3 data files or file streams using your editions-syntax proto definitions.

### Grammar Changes {#syntax}

There are some grammar changes in editions compared to proto2 and proto3.

#### Syntax Description {#syntax-descrip}

Instead of the `syntax` element, you use an `edition` element:

```proto
syntax = "proto2";
syntax = "proto3";
edition = "2028";
```

#### Reserved Names {#reserved-names}

You no longer put field names and enum value names in quotation marks when
reserving them:

```proto
reserved foo, bar;
```

#### Group Syntax {#group-syntax}

Group syntax, available in proto2, is removed in editions. The special
wire-format that groups used is still available by using `DELIMITED` message
encoding.

#### Required Label {#required-label}

The `required` label, available only in proto2, is unavailable in editions. The
underlying functionality is still available
by using `features.field_presence=LEGACY_REQUIRED`.

#### `import option` {#import-option}

Edition 2024 added support for option imports using the syntax `import option`.

Option imports must come after any other `import` statements.

Unlike normal `import` statements, option imports import only custom options
defined in a `.proto` file, without importing other symbols.

This means that messages and enums are excluded from the option import. In the
following example, the `Bar` message cannot be used as a field type in
`foo.proto`, but options with type `Bar` can still be set.

```proto
// bar.proto
edition = "2024";

import "google/protobuf/descriptor.proto";

message Bar {
  bool bar = 1;
}

extend proto2.FileOptions {
  bool file_opt1 = 5000;
  Bar file_opt2 = 5001;
}

// foo.proto:
edition = "2024";

import option "bar.proto";

option (file_opt1) = true;
option (file_opt2) = {bar: true};

message Foo {
  // Bar bar = 1; // This is not allowed
}
```

Option imports do not require generated code for its symbols and should thus be
provided as `option_deps` in `proto_library` instead of `deps`. This avoids
generating unreachable code.

```proto
proto_library(
  name = "foo",
  srcs = ["foo.proto"],
  option_deps = [":custom_option_proto"]
)
```

Option imports and `option_deps` are strongly recommended when importing
protobuf language features and other custom options to avoid generating
unnecessary code.

This replaces `import weak`, which was removed in Edition 2024.

#### `export` / `local` Keywords {#export-local}

`export` and `local` keywords were added in Edition 2024 as modifiers for the
symbol visibility of importable symbols, from the default behavior specified by
[`features.default_symbol_visibility`](/editions/features#symbol-vis).

This controls which symbols can be imported from other proto files, but does not
affect code-generation.

In Edition 2024, these can be set on all `message` and `enum` symbols by
default. However, some values of the `default_symbol_visibility` feature further
restrict which symbols are exportable.

Example:

```proto
// Top-level symbols are exported by default in Edition 2024
message LocalMessage {
  int32 baz = 1;
  // Nested symbols are local by default in Edition 2024; applying the `export`
  // keyword overrides this
  export enum ExportedNestedEnum {
    UNKNOWN_EXPORTED_NESTED_ENUM_VALUE = 0;
  }
}

// The `local` keyword overrides the default behavior of exporting messages
local message AnotherMessage {
  int32 foo = 1;
}
```

#### `import weak` and Weak Field Option {#import-weak}

As of Edition 2024, weak imports are no longer allowed.

If you previously relied on `import weak` to declare a "weak
dependency"&mdash;to import custom options without generated code for C++ and
Go&mdash;you should instead migrate to use `import option`.

See [`import option`](/editions/overview#import-option)
for more details.

#### `ctype` Field Option {#ctype}

As of Edition 2024, `ctype` field option is no longer allowed. Use the
`string_type` feature instead.

See
[`features.(pb.cpp).string_type`](/editions/features#string_type)
for more details.

#### `java_multiple_files` File Option {#java-mult-files}

As of Edition 2024, the `java_multiple_files` file option no longer available.
Use the
[`features.(pb.java).nest_in_file_class`](/editions/features#java-nest_in_file)
Java feature, instead.
