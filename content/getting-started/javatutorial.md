This tutorial provides a basic Java programmer's introduction to working with
protocol buffers. By walking through creating a simple example application, it
shows you how to

-   Define message formats in a `.proto` file.
-   Use the protocol buffer compiler.
-   Use the Java protocol buffer API to write and read messages.

This isn't a comprehensive guide to using protocol buffers in Java. For more
detailed reference information, see the
[Protocol Buffer Language Guide (proto2)](/programming-guides/proto),
the
[Protocol Buffer Language Guide (proto3)](/programming-guides/proto3),
the
[Java API Reference](/reference/java/api-docs/overview-summary.html),
the
[Java Generated Code Guide](/reference/java/java-generated),
and the
[Encoding Reference](/programming-guides/encoding).

## The Problem Domain {#problem-domain}

The example we're going to use is a very simple "address book" application that
can read and write people's contact details to and from a file. Each person in
the address book has a name, an ID, an email address, and a contact phone
number.

How do you serialize and retrieve structured data like this? There are a few
ways to solve this problem:

-   Use Java Serialization. This is the default approach since it's built into
    the language, but it has a host of well-known problems (see Effective Java,
    by Josh Bloch pp. 213), and also doesn't work very well if you need to share
    data with applications written in C++ or Python.
-   You can invent an ad-hoc way to encode the data items into a single
    string -- such as encoding 4 ints as "12:3:-23:67". This is a simple and
    flexible approach, although it does require writing one-off encoding and
    parsing code, and the parsing imposes a small run-time cost. This works best
    for encoding very simple data.
-   Serialize the data to XML. This approach can be very attractive since XML is
    (sort of) human readable and there are binding libraries for lots of
    languages. This can be a good choice if you want to share data with other
    applications/projects. However, XML is notoriously space intensive, and
    encoding/decoding it can impose a huge performance penalty on applications.
    Also, navigating an XML DOM tree is considerably more complicated than
    navigating simple fields in a class normally would be.

Instead of these options, you can use protocol buffers. Protocol buffers are the
flexible, efficient, automated solution to solve exactly this problem. With
protocol buffers, you write a `.proto` description of the data structure you
wish to store. From that, the protocol buffer compiler creates a class that
implements automatic encoding and parsing of the protocol buffer data with an
efficient binary format. The generated class provides getters and setters for
the fields that make up a protocol buffer and takes care of the details of
reading and writing the protocol buffer as a unit. Importantly, the protocol
buffer format supports the idea of extending the format over time in such a way
that the code can still read data encoded with the old format.

## Where to Find the Example Code {#example-code}

The example code is included in the source code package, under the "examples"
directory. [Download it here.](/downloads)

## Defining Your Protocol Format {#protocol-format}

To create your address book application, you'll need to start with a `.proto`
file. The definitions in a `.proto` file are simple: you add a *message* for
each data structure you want to serialize, then specify a name and a type for
each field in the message. Here is the `.proto` file that defines your messages,
`addressbook.proto`.

```proto
syntax = "proto2";

package tutorial;

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "com.example.tutorial.protos";
option java_outer_classname = "AddressBookProtos";

message Person {
  optional string name = 1;
  optional int32 id = 2;
  optional string email = 3;

  enum PhoneType {
    PHONE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
    PHONE_TYPE_MOBILE = 1;
    PHONE_TYPE_HOME = 2;
    PHONE_TYPE_WORK = 3;
  }

  message PhoneNumber {
    optional string number = 1;
    optional PhoneType type = 2 [default = PHONE_TYPE_HOME];
  }

  repeated PhoneNumber phones = 4;
}

message AddressBook {
  repeated Person people = 1;
}
```

As you can see, the syntax is similar to C++ or Java. Let's go through each part
of the file and see what it does.

The `.proto` file starts with a package declaration, which helps to prevent
naming conflicts between different projects. In Java, the package name is used
as the Java package unless you have explicitly specified a `java_package`, as we
have here. Even if you do provide a `java_package`, you should still define a
normal `package` as well to avoid name collisions in the Protocol Buffers name
space as well as in non-Java languages.

After the package declaration, you can see three options that are Java-specific:
`java_multiple_files`, `java_package`, and `java_outer_classname`.
`java_package` specifies in what Java package name your generated classes should
live. If you don't specify this explicitly, it simply matches the package name
given by the `package` declaration, but these names usually aren't appropriate
Java package names (since they usually don't start with a domain name). The
`java_outer_classname` option defines the class name of the wrapper class which
will represent this file. If you don't give a `java_outer_classname` explicitly,
it will be generated by converting the file name to upper camel case. For
example, "my_proto.proto" would, by default, use "MyProto" as the wrapper class
name. The `java_multiple_files = true` option enables generating a separate
`.java` file for each generated class (instead of the legacy behavior of
generating a single `.java` file for the wrapper class, using the wrapper class
as an outer class, and nesting all the other classes inside the wrapper class).

Next, you have your message definitions. A message is just an aggregate
containing a set of typed fields. Many standard simple data types are available
as field types, including `bool`, `int32`, `float`, `double`, and `string`. You
can also add further structure to your messages by using other message types as
field types -- in the above example the `Person` message contains `PhoneNumber`
messages, while the `AddressBook` message contains `Person` messages. You can
even define message types nested inside other messages -- as you can see, the
`PhoneNumber` type is defined inside `Person`. You can also define `enum` types
if you want one of your fields to have one of a predefined list of values --
here you want to specify that a phone number can be one of the following phone
types: `PHONE_TYPE_MOBILE`, `PHONE_TYPE_HOME`, or `PHONE_TYPE_WORK`.

The " = 1", " = 2" markers on each element identify the unique "tag" that field
uses in the binary encoding. Tag numbers 1-15 require one less byte to encode
than higher numbers, so as an optimization you can decide to use those tags for
the commonly used or repeated elements, leaving tags 16 and higher for
less-commonly used optional elements. Each element in a repeated field requires
re-encoding the tag number, so repeated fields are particularly good candidates
for this optimization.

Each field must be annotated with one of the following modifiers:

-   `optional`: the field may or may not be set. If an optional field value
    isn't set, a default value is used. For simple types, you can specify your
    own default value, as we've done for the phone number `type` in the example.
    Otherwise, a system default is used: zero for numeric types, the empty
    string for strings, false for bools. For embedded messages, the default
    value is always the "default instance" or "prototype" of the message, which
    has none of its fields set. Calling the accessor to get the value of an
    optional (or required) field which has not been explicitly set always
    returns that field's default value.
-   `repeated`: the field may be repeated any number of times (including zero).
    The order of the repeated values will be preserved in the protocol buffer.
    Think of repeated fields as dynamically sized arrays.
-   `required`: a value for the field must be provided, otherwise the message
    will be considered "uninitialized". Trying to build an uninitialized message
    will throw a `RuntimeException`. Parsing an uninitialized message will throw
    an `IOException`. Other than this, a required field behaves exactly like an
    optional field.

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}} **Required Is Forever**
You should be very careful about marking fields as `required`. If at some point
you wish to stop writing or sending a required field, it will be problematic to
change the field to an optional field -- old readers will consider messages
without this field to be incomplete and may reject or drop them unintentionally.
You should consider writing application-specific custom validation routines for
your buffers instead. Within Google, `required` fields are strongly disfavored;
most messages defined in proto2 syntax use `optional` and `repeated` only.
(Proto3 does not support `required` fields at all.)
{{% /alert %}}

You'll find a complete guide to writing `.proto` files -- including all the
possible field types -- in the
[Protocol Buffer Language Guide](/programming-guides/proto).
Don't go looking for facilities similar to class inheritance, though -- protocol
buffers don't do that.

## Compiling Your Protocol Buffers {#compiling-protocol-buffers}

Now that you have a `.proto`, the next thing you need to do is generate the
classes you'll need to read and write `AddressBook` (and hence `Person` and
`PhoneNumber`) messages. To do this, you need to run the protocol buffer
compiler `protoc` on your `.proto`:

1.  If you haven't installed the compiler,
    [download the package](/downloads) and follow the
    instructions in the README.

1.  Now run the compiler, specifying the source directory (where your
    application's source code lives -- the current directory is used if you
    don't provide a value), the destination directory (where you want the
    generated code to go; often the same as `$SRC_DIR`), and the path to your
    `.proto`. In this case, you...:

    ```shell
    protoc -I=$SRC_DIR --java_out=$DST_DIR $SRC_DIR/addressbook.proto
    ```

    Because you want Java classes, you use the `--java_out` option -- similar
    options are provided for other supported languages.

This generates a `com/example/tutorial/protos/` subdirectory in your specified
destination directory, containing a few generated `.java` files.

## The Protocol Buffer API {#protobuf-api}

Let's look at some of the generated code and see what classes and methods the
compiler has created for you. If you look in `com/example/tutorial/protos/`, you
can see that it contains `.java` files defining a class for each message you
specified in `addressbook.proto`. Each class has its own `Builder` class that
you use to create instances of that class. You can find out more about builders
in the [Builders vs. Messages](#builders-messages) section below.

Both messages and builders have auto-generated accessor methods for each field
of the message; messages have only getters while builders have both getters and
setters. Here are some of the accessors for the `Person` class (implementations
omitted for brevity):

```java
// required string name = 1;
public boolean hasName();
public String getName();

// required int32 id = 2;
public boolean hasId();
public int getId();

// optional string email = 3;
public boolean hasEmail();
public String getEmail();

// repeated .tutorial.Person.PhoneNumber phones = 4;
public List<PhoneNumber> getPhonesList();
public int getPhonesCount();
public PhoneNumber getPhones(int index);
```

Meanwhile, `Person.Builder` has the same getters plus setters:

```java
// required string name = 1;
public boolean hasName();
public java.lang.String getName();
public Builder setName(String value);
public Builder clearName();

// required int32 id = 2;
public boolean hasId();
public int getId();
public Builder setId(int value);
public Builder clearId();

// optional string email = 3;
public boolean hasEmail();
public String getEmail();
public Builder setEmail(String value);
public Builder clearEmail();

// repeated .tutorial.Person.PhoneNumber phones = 4;
public List<PhoneNumber> getPhonesList();
public int getPhonesCount();
public PhoneNumber getPhones(int index);
public Builder setPhones(int index, PhoneNumber value);
public Builder addPhones(PhoneNumber value);
public Builder addAllPhones(Iterable<PhoneNumber> value);
public Builder clearPhones();
```

As you can see, there are simple JavaBeans-style getters and setters for each
field. There are also `has` getters for each singular field which return true if
that field has been set. Finally, each field has a `clear` method that un-sets
the field back to its empty state.

Repeated fields have some extra methods -- a `Count` method (which is just
shorthand for the list's size), getters and setters which get or set a specific
element of the list by index, an `add` method which appends a new element to the
list, and an `addAll` method which adds an entire container full of elements to
the list.

Notice how these accessor methods use camel-case naming, even though the
`.proto` file uses lowercase-with-underscores. This transformation is done
automatically by the protocol buffer compiler so that the generated classes
match standard Java style conventions. You should always use
lowercase-with-underscores for field names in your `.proto` files; this ensures
good naming practice in all the generated languages. See the
[style guide](/programming-guides/style) for more on good
`.proto` style.

For more information on exactly what members the protocol compiler generates for
any particular field definition, see the
[Java generated code reference](/reference/java/java-generated).

### Enums and Nested Classes {#enums-nested-classes}

The generated code includes a `PhoneType` Java 5 enum, nested within `Person`:

```java
public static enum PhoneType {
  PHONE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED(0, 0),
  PHONE_TYPE_MOBILE(1, 1),
  PHONE_TYPE_HOME(2, 2),
  PHONE_TYPE_WORK(3, 3),
  ;
  ...
}
```

The nested type `Person.PhoneNumber` is generated, as you'd expect, as a nested
class within `Person`.

### Builders vs. Messages {#builders-messages}

The message classes generated by the protocol buffer compiler are all
*immutable*. Once a message object is constructed, it cannot be modified, just
like a Java `String`. To construct a message, you must first construct a
builder, set any fields you want to set to your chosen values, then call the
builder's `build()` method.

You may have noticed that each method of the builder which modifies the message
returns another builder. The returned object is actually the same builder on
which you called the method. It is returned for convenience so that you can
string several setters together on a single line of code.

Here's an example of how you would create an instance of `Person`:

```java
Person john =
  Person.newBuilder()
    .setId(1234)
    .setName("John Doe")
    .setEmail("jdoe@example.com")
    .addPhones(
      Person.PhoneNumber.newBuilder()
        .setNumber("555-4321")
        .setType(Person.PhoneType.PHONE_TYPE_HOME)
        .build())
    .build();
```

### Standard Message Methods {#standard-message-methods}

Each message and builder class also contains a number of other methods that let
you check or manipulate the entire message, including:

-   `isInitialized()`: checks if all the required fields have been set.
-   `toString()`: returns a human-readable representation of the message,
    particularly useful for debugging.
-   `mergeFrom(Message other)`: (builder only) merges the contents of `other`
    into this message, overwriting singular scalar fields, merging composite
    fields, and concatenating repeated fields.
-   `clear()`: (builder only) clears all the fields back to the empty state.

These methods implement the `Message` and `Message.Builder` interfaces shared by
all Java messages and builders. For more information, see the
[complete API documentation for `Message`](/reference/java/api-docs/com/google/protobuf/Message.html).

### Parsing and Serialization {#parsing-serialization}

Finally, each protocol buffer class has methods for writing and reading messages
of your chosen type using the protocol buffer
[binary format](/programming-guides/encoding). These
include:

-   `byte[] toByteArray();`: serializes the message and returns a byte array
    containing its raw bytes.
-   `static Person parseFrom(byte[] data);`: parses a message from the given
    byte array.
-   `void writeTo(OutputStream output);`: serializes the message and writes it
    to an `OutputStream`.
-   `static Person parseFrom(InputStream input);`: reads and parses a message
    from an `InputStream`.

These are just a couple of the options provided for parsing and serialization.
Again, see the
[`Message` API reference](/reference/java/api-docs/com/google/protobuf/Message.html)
for a complete list.

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}} **Protocol Buffers and Object Oriented Design**
Protocol buffer classes are basically data holders (like structs in C) that
don't provide additional functionality; they don't make good first class
citizens in an object model. If you want to add richer behavior to a generated
class, the best way to do this is to wrap the generated protocol buffer class in
an application-specific class. Wrapping protocol buffers is also a good idea if
you don't have control over the design of the `.proto` file (if, say, you're
reusing one from another project). In that case, you can use the wrapper class
to craft an interface better suited to the unique environment of your
application: hiding some data and methods, exposing convenience functions, etc.
**You should never add behavior to the generated classes by inheriting from
them**. This will break internal mechanisms and is not good object-oriented
practice anyway. {{% /alert %}}

## Writing a Message {#writing-a-message}

Now let's try using your protocol buffer classes. The first thing you want your
address book application to be able to do is write personal details to your
address book file. To do this, you need to create and populate instances of your
protocol buffer classes and then write them to an output stream.

Here is a program which reads an `AddressBook` from a file, adds one new
`Person` to it based on user input, and writes the new `AddressBook` back out to
the file again. The parts which directly call or reference code generated by the
protocol compiler are highlighted.

```java
import com.example.tutorial.protos.AddressBook;
import com.example.tutorial.protos.Person;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintStream;

class AddPerson {
  // This function fills in a Person message based on user input.
  static Person PromptForAddress(BufferedReader stdin,
                                 PrintStream stdout) throws IOException {
    Person.Builder person = Person.newBuilder();

    stdout.print("Enter person ID: ");
    person.setId(Integer.valueOf(stdin.readLine()));

    stdout.print("Enter name: ");
    person.setName(stdin.readLine());

    stdout.print("Enter email address (blank for none): ");
    String email = stdin.readLine();
    if (email.length() > 0) {
      person.setEmail(email);
    }

    while (true) {
      stdout.print("Enter a phone number (or leave blank to finish): ");
      String number = stdin.readLine();
      if (number.length() == 0) {
        break;
      }

      Person.PhoneNumber.Builder phoneNumber =
        Person.PhoneNumber.newBuilder().setNumber(number);

      stdout.print("Is this a mobile, home, or work phone? ");
      String type = stdin.readLine();
      if (type.equals("mobile")) {
        phoneNumber.setType(Person.PhoneType.PHONE_TYPE_MOBILE);
      } else if (type.equals("home")) {
        phoneNumber.setType(Person.PhoneType.PHONE_TYPE_HOME);
      } else if (type.equals("work")) {
        phoneNumber.setType(Person.PhoneType.PHONE_TYPE_WORK);
      } else {
        stdout.println("Unknown phone type.  Using default.");
      }

      person.addPhones(phoneNumber);
    }

    return person.build();
  }

  // Main function:  Reads the entire address book from a file,
  //   adds one person based on user input, then writes it back out to the same
  //   file.
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    if (args.length != 1) {
      System.err.println("Usage:  AddPerson ADDRESS_BOOK_FILE");
      System.exit(-1);
    }

    AddressBook.Builder addressBook = AddressBook.newBuilder();

    // Read the existing address book.
    try {
      addressBook.mergeFrom(new FileInputStream(args[0]));
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
      System.out.println(args[0] + ": File not found.  Creating a new file.");
    }

    // Add an address.
    addressBook.addPeople(
      PromptForAddress(new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)),
                       System.out));

    // Write the new address book back to disk.
    FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(args[0]);
    addressBook.build().writeTo(output);
    output.close();
  }
}
```

## Reading a Message {#reading-a-message}

Of course, an address book wouldn't be much use if you couldn't get any
information out of it! This example reads the file created by the above example
and prints all the information in it.

```java
import com.example.tutorial.protos.AddressBook;
import com.example.tutorial.protos.Person;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintStream;

class ListPeople {
  // Iterates though all people in the AddressBook and prints info about them.
  static void Print(AddressBook addressBook) {
    for (Person person: addressBook.getPeopleList()) {
      System.out.println("Person ID: " + person.getId());
      System.out.println("  Name: " + person.getName());
      if (person.hasEmail()) {
        System.out.println("  E-mail address: " + person.getEmail());
      }

      for (Person.PhoneNumber phoneNumber : person.getPhonesList()) {
        switch (phoneNumber.getType()) {
          case PHONE_TYPE_MOBILE:
            System.out.print("  Mobile phone #: ");
            break;
          case PHONE_TYPE_HOME:
            System.out.print("  Home phone #: ");
            break;
          case PHONE_TYPE_WORK:
            System.out.print("  Work phone #: ");
            break;
        }
        System.out.println(phoneNumber.getNumber());
      }
    }
  }

  // Main function:  Reads the entire address book from a file and prints all
  //   the information inside.
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    if (args.length != 1) {
      System.err.println("Usage:  ListPeople ADDRESS_BOOK_FILE");
      System.exit(-1);
    }

    // Read the existing address book.
    AddressBook addressBook =
      AddressBook.parseFrom(new FileInputStream(args[0]));

    Print(addressBook);
  }
}
```

## Extending a Protocol Buffer {#extending-a-protobuf}

Sooner or later after you release the code that uses your protocol buffer, you
will undoubtedly want to "improve" the protocol buffer's definition. If you want
your new buffers to be backwards-compatible, and your old buffers to be
forward-compatible -- and you almost certainly do want this -- then there are
some rules you need to follow. In the new version of the protocol buffer:

-   you *must not* change the tag numbers of any existing fields.
-   you *must not* add or delete any required fields.
-   you *may* delete optional or repeated fields.
-   you *may* add new optional or repeated fields but you must use fresh tag
    numbers (that is, tag numbers that were never used in this protocol buffer,
    not even by deleted fields).

(There are
[some exceptions](/programming-guides/proto#updating) to
these rules, but they are rarely used.)

If you follow these rules, old code will happily read new messages and simply
ignore any new fields. To the old code, optional fields that were deleted will
simply have their default value, and deleted repeated fields will be empty. New
code will also transparently read old messages. However, keep in mind that new
optional fields will not be present in old messages, so you will need to either
check explicitly whether they're set with `has_`, or provide a reasonable
default value in your `.proto` file with `[default = value]` after the tag
number. If the default value is not specified for an optional element, a
type-specific default value is used instead: for strings, the default value is
the empty string. For booleans, the default value is false. For numeric types,
the default value is zero. Note also that if you added a new repeated field,
your new code will not be able to tell whether it was left empty (by new code)
or never set at all (by old code) since there is no `has_` flag for it.

## Advanced Usage {#advanced-usage}

Protocol buffers have uses that go beyond simple accessors and serialization. Be
sure to explore the
[Java API reference](/reference/java/api-docs/index-all.html)
to see what else you can do with them.

One key feature provided by protocol message classes is *reflection*. You can
iterate over the fields of a message and manipulate their values without writing
your code against any specific message type. One very useful way to use
reflection is for converting protocol messages to and from other encodings, such
as XML or JSON. A more advanced use of reflection might be to find differences
between two messages of the same type, or to develop a sort of "regular
expressions for protocol messages" in which you can write expressions that match
certain message contents. If you use your imagination, it's possible to apply
Protocol Buffers to a much wider range of problems than you might initially
expect!

Reflection is provided as part of the
[`Message`](/reference/java/api-docs/com/google/protobuf/Message.html)
and
[`Message.Builder`](/reference/java/api-docs/com/google/protobuf/Message.Builder.html)
interfaces.
