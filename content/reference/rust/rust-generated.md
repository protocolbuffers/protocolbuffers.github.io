This page describes exactly what Rust code the protocol buffer compiler
generates for any given protocol definition.

This document covers how the protocol buffer compiler generates Rust code for
proto2, proto3, and protobuf editions. Any differences between proto2, proto3,
and editions generated code are highlighted. You should read the
[proto2 language guide](/programming-guides/proto2),
[proto3 language guide](/programming-guides/proto3), or
[editions guide](/programming-guides/editions) before
reading this document.

## Protobuf Rust {#rust}

Protobuf Rust is an implementation of protocol buffers designed to be able to
sit on top of other existing protocol buffer implementations that we refer to as
'kernels'.

The decision to support multiple non-Rust kernels has significantly influenced
our public API, including the choice to use custom types like `ProtoStr` over
Rust std types like `str`. See
[Rust Proto Design Decisions](/reference/rust/rust-design-decisions)
for more on this topic.

## Generated Filenames {#filenames}

Each `rust_proto_library` will be compiled as one crate. Most importantly, for
every `.proto` file in the `srcs` of the corresponding `proto_library`, one Rust
file is emitted, and all these files form a single crate.

Files generated by the compiler vary between kernels. In general, the names of
the output files are computed by taking the name of the `.proto` file and
replacing the extension.

Generated files:

*   C++ kernel:
    *   `.c.pb.rs` - generated Rust code
    *   `.pb.thunks.cc` - generated C++ thunks (glue code that Rust code calls,
        and that delegates to the C++ Protobuf APIs).
*   C++ Lite kernel:
    *   &lt;same as C++ kernel&gt;
*   UPB kernel
    *   `.u.pb.rs` - generated Rust code.

Each `proto_library` will also have a `generated.rs` file which is treated as
the entry point for the crate. That file will re-export the symbols from all the
other Rust files in the crate.

## Packages {#packages}

Unlike in most other languages, the `package` declarations in the `.proto` files
are not used in Rust codegen. Instead, each `rust_proto_library(name =
"some_rust_proto")` target emits a crate named `some_rust_proto` which contains
the generated code for all `.proto` files in the target.

## Messages {#messages}

Given the message declaration:

```proto
message Foo {}
```

The compiler generates a struct named `Foo`. The `Foo` struct defines the
following associated functions and methods:

### Associated Functions

*   `fn new() -> Self`: Creates a new instance of `Foo`.

### Traits

For a number of reasons, including gencode size, name collision problems, and
gencode stability, most common functionality on messages is implemented on
traits instead of as inherent implementations.

Most users should import our prelude, which only includes traits and our
`proto!` macro and no other types (`use protobuf::prelude::*`). If you would
rather avoid preludes, you can always import the specific traits as needed (see
the
<!-- TODO: replace `4.32.0-prerelease` with `latest` once we do a stable release -->
[documentation here](https://docs.rs/protobuf/4.32.0-release/protobuf/trait.Message.html)
for the names and definitions of the traits if you want to import them
directly).

*   `fn parse(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, ParseError>`: Parses a new instance
    of a message.
*   `fn parse_dont_enforce_required(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Self, ParseError>`:
    Same as `parse` but does not fail on missing proto2 `required` fields.
*   `fn clear(&mut self)`: Clears message.
*   `fn clear_and_parse(&mut self, data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), ParseError>`:
    Clearing and parsing into an existing instance.
*   `fn clear_and_parse_dont_enforce_required(&mut self, data: &[u8]) ->
    Result<(), ParseError>`: Same as `parse` but does not fail on missing proto2
    `required` fields.
*   `fn serialize(&self) -> Result<Vec<u8>, SerializeError>`: Serializes the
    message to Protobuf wire format. Serialization can fail but rarely will.
    Failure reasons include if the representation exceeds the maximum encoded
    message size (must be less than 2 GiB), and `required` fields (proto2) that
    are unset.
*   `fn take_from(&mut self, other)`: Moves `other` into `self`, discarding any
    previous state that `self` contained.
*   `fn copy_from(&mut self, other)`: Copies `other` into `self`, discarding any
    previous state that `self` contained. `other` is unmodified.
*   `fn merge_from(&mut self, other)`: Merges `other` into `self`.
*   `fn as_view(&self) -> FooView<'_>`: Returns an immutable handle (view) to
    `Foo`. This is further covered in the section on proxy types.
*   `fn as_mut(&mut self) -> FooMut<'_>`: Returns a mutable handle (mut) to
    `Foo`. This is further covered in the section on proxy types.

`Foo` additionally implements the following std traits:

*   `std::fmt::Debug`
*   `std::default::Default`
*   `std::clone::Clone`
*   `std::marker::Send`
*   `std::marker::Sync`

### Fluently Create New Instances {#proto-macro}

The API design of setters follows our established Protobuf idioms, but the
verbosity when constructing new instances is a mild pain point in certain other
languages. To mitigate this, we offer a `proto!` macro, which can be used to
more-succinctly/fluently create new instances.

For example, instead of writing this:

```
let mut msg = SomeMsg::new();
msg.set_x(1);
msg.set_y("hello");
msg.some_submessage_mut().set_z(42);
```

This macro can be used to write it as follows:

```
let msg = proto!(SomeMsg {
  x: 1,
  y: "hello",
  some_submsg: SomeSubmsg {
    z: 42
  }
});
```

### Message Proxy Types {#message-proxy-types}

For a number of technical reasons, we have chosen to avoid using native Rust
references (`&T` and `&mut T`) in certain cases. Instead, we need to express
these concepts using types - `View`s and `Mut`s. These situations are shared and
mutable references to:

*   Messages
*   Repeated fields
*   Map fields

For example, the compiler emits structs `FooView<'a>` and `FooMut<'msg>`
alongside `Foo`. These types are used in place of `&Foo` and `&mut Foo`, and
they behave the same as native Rust references in terms of borrow checker
behavior. Just like native borrows, Views are `Copy` and the borrow checker will
enforce that you can either have any number of Views or at most one Mut live at
a given time.

For the purposes of this documentation, we focus on describing all methods
emitted for the owned message type (`Foo`). A subset of these functions with
`&self` receiver will also be included on the `FooView<'msg>`. A subset of these
functions with either `&self` or `&mut self` will also be included on the
`FooMut<'msg>`.

To create an owned message type from a View / Mut type call `to_owned()`, which
creates a deep copy.

See the corresponding section in our
[design decisions](/reference/rust/rust-design-decisions#view-mut-proxy-types)
documentation for more discussion about why this choice was made.

## Nested Types {#nested-types}

Given the message declaration:

```proto
message Foo {
  message Bar {
      enum Baz { ... }
  }
}
```

In addition to the struct named `Foo`, a module named `foo` is created to
contain the struct for `Bar`. And similarly a nested module named `bar` to
contain the deeply nested enum `Baz`:

```rs
pub struct Foo {}

pub mod foo {
   pub struct Bar {}
   pub mod bar {
      pub struct Baz { ... }
   }
}
```

## Fields {#fields}

In addition to the methods described in the previous section, the protocol
buffer compiler generates a set of accessor methods for each field defined
within the message in the `.proto` file.

Following Rust style, the methods are in lower-case/snake-case, such as
`has_foo()` and `clear_foo()`. Note that the capitalization of the field name
portion of the accessor maintains the style from the original .proto file, which
in turn should be lower-case/snake-case per the
[.proto file style guide](/programming-guides/style).

### Fields with Explicit Presence {#explicit-presence}

Explicit presence means that a field distinguishes between the default value and
no value set. In proto2, `optional` fields have explicit presence. In proto3,
only message fields and `oneof` or `optional` fields have explicit presence.
Presence is set using the
[`features.field_presence`](/editions/features#field_presence)
option in editions.

#### Numeric Fields {#numeric-fields}

For this field definition:

```proto
int32 foo = 1;
```

The compiler generates the following accessor methods:

*   `fn has_foo(&self) -> bool`: Returns `true` if the field is set.
*   `fn foo(&self) -> i32`: Returns the current value of the field. If the field
    is not set, it returns the default value.
*   `fn foo_opt(&self) -> protobuf::Optional<i32>`: Returns an optional with the
    variant `Set(value)` if the field is set or `Unset(default value)` if it's
    unset.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, val: i32)`: Sets the value of the field. After
    calling this, `has_foo()` will return `true` and `foo()` will return
    `value`.
*   `fn clear_foo(&mut self)`: Clears the value of the field. After calling
    this, `has_foo()` will return `false` and `foo()` will return the default
    value.

For other numeric field types (including `bool`), `int32` is replaced with the
corresponding Rust type according to the
[scalar value types table](/programming-guides/proto3#scalar).

#### String and Bytes Fields {#string-byte-fields}

For these field definitions:

```proto
string foo = 1;
bytes foo = 1;
```

The compiler generates the following accessor methods:

*   `fn has_foo(&self) -> bool`: Returns `true` if the field is set.
*   `fn foo(&self) -> &protobuf::ProtoStr`: Returns the current value of the
    field. If the field is not set, it returns the default value.
*   `fn foo_opt(&self) -> protobuf::Optional<&ProtoStr>`: Returns an optional
    with the variant `Set(value)` if the field is set or `Unset(default value)`
    if it's unset.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, val: impl IntoProxied<ProtoString>)`: Sets the value
    of the field.
*   `fn clear_foo(&mut self)`: Clears the value of the field. After calling
    this, `has_foo()` will return `false` and `foo()` will return the default
    value.

For fields of type `bytes` the compiler will generate the `ProtoBytes` type
instead.

#### Enum Fields {#enum-fields}

Given this enum definition in any proto syntax version:

```proto
enum Bar {
  BAR_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  BAR_VALUE = 1;
  BAR_OTHER_VALUE = 2;
}
```

The compiler generates a struct where each variant is an associated constant:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
#[repr(transparent)]
pub struct Bar(i32);

impl Bar {
  pub const Unspecified: Bar = Bar(0);
  pub const Value: Bar = Bar(1);
  pub const OtherValue: Bar = Bar(2);
}
```

For this field definition:

```proto
Bar foo = 1;
```

The compiler generates the following accessor methods:

*   `fn has_foo(&self) -> bool`: Returns `true` if the field is set.
*   `fn foo(&self) -> Bar`: Returns the current value of the field. If the field
    is not set, it returns the default value.
*   `fn foo_opt(&self) -> Optional<Bar>`: Returns an optional with the variant
    `Set(value)` if the field is set or `Unset(default value)` if it's unset.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, val: Bar)`: Sets the value of the field. After
    calling this, `has_foo()` will return `true` and `foo()` will return
    `value`.
*   `fn clear_foo(&mut self)`: Clears the value of the field. After calling
    this, `has_foo()` will return false and `foo()` will return the default
    value.

#### Embedded Message Fields {#embedded-message-fields}

Given the message type `Bar` from any proto syntax version:

```proto
message Bar {}
```

For any of these field definitions:

```proto

message MyMessage {
  Bar foo = 1;
}
```

The compiler will generate the following accessor methods:

*   `fn foo(&self) -> BarView<'_>`: Returns a view of the current value of the
    field. If the field is not set it returns an empty message.
*   `fn foo_mut(&mut self) -> BarMut<'_>`: Returns a mutable handle to the
    current value of the field. Sets the field if it is not set. After calling
    this method, `has_foo()` returns true.
*   `fn foo_opt(&self) -> protobuf::Optional<BarView>`: If the field is set,
    returns the variant `Set` with its `value`. Else returns the variant `Unset`
    with the default value.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, value: impl protobuf::IntoProxied<Bar>)`: Sets the
    field to `value`. After calling this method, `has_foo()` returns `true`.
*   `fn has_foo(&self) -> bool`: Returns `true` if the field is set.
*   `fn clear_foo(&mut self)`: Clears the field. After calling this method
    `has_foo()` returns `false`.

### Fields with Implicit Presence (proto3 and Editions) {#implicit-presence}

Implicit presence means that a field does not distinguish between the default
value and no value set. In proto3, fields have implicit presence by default. In
editions, you can declare a field with implicit presence by setting the
`field_presence` feature to `IMPLICIT`.

#### Numeric Fields {#implicit-numeric-fields}

For these field definitions:

```proto
// proto3
int32 foo = 1;

// editions
message MyMessage {
  int32 foo = 1 [features.field_presence = IMPLICIT];
}
```

The compiler generates the following accessor methods:

*   `fn foo(&self) -> i32`: Returns the current value of the field. If the field
    is not set, it returns `0`.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, val: i32)`: Sets the value of the field.

For other numeric field types (including `bool`), `int32` is replaced with the
corresponding Rust type according to the
[scalar value types table](/programming-guides/proto3#scalar).

#### String and Bytes Fields {#implicit-string-byte-fields}

For these field definitions:

```proto
// proto3
string foo = 1;
bytes foo = 1;

// editions
string foo = 1 [features.field_presence = IMPLICIT];
bytes bar = 2 [features.field_presence = IMPLICIT];
```

The compiler will generate the following accessor methods:

*   `fn foo(&self) -> &ProtoStr`: Returns the current value of the field. If the
    field is not set, returns the empty string/empty bytes.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, value: IntoProxied<ProtoString>)`: Sets the field to
    `value`.

For fields of type `bytes` the compiler will generate the `ProtoBytes` type
instead.

### Singular String and Bytes Fields with Cord Support {#singular-string-bytes}

`[ctype = CORD]` enables bytes and strings to be stored as an
[absl::Cord](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/strings/cord.h)
in C++ Protobufs. `absl::Cord` currently does not have an equivalent type in
Rust . Protobuf Rust uses an enum to represent a cord
field:

```proto
enum ProtoStringCow<'a> {
  Owned(ProtoString),
  Borrowed(&'a ProtoStr)
}
```

In the common case, for small strings, an `absl::Cord` stores its data as a
contiguous string. In this case cord accessors return
`ProtoStringCow::Borrowed`. If the underlying `absl::Cord` is non-contiguous,
the accessor copies the data from the cord into an owned `ProtoString` and
returns `ProtoStringCow::Owned`. The `ProtoStringCow` implements
`Deref<Target=ProtoStr>`.

For any of these field definitions:

```proto
optional string foo = 1 [ctype = CORD];
string foo = 1 [ctype = CORD];
optional bytes foo = 1 [ctype = CORD];
bytes foo = 1 [ctype = CORD];
```

The compiler generates the following accessor methods:

*   `fn my_field(&self) -> ProtoStringCow<'_>`: Returns the current value of the
    field. If the field is not set, returns the empty string/empty bytes.
*   `fn set_my_field(&mut self, value: IntoProxied<ProtoString>)`: Sets the
    field to `value`. After calling this function `foo()` returns `value` and
    `has_foo()` returns `true`.
*   `fn has_foo(&self) -> bool`: Returns `true` if the field is set.
*   `fn clear_foo(&mut self)`: Clears the value of the field. After calling
    this, `has_foo()` returns `false` and `foo()` returns the default value.
    Cords have not been implemented yet.

For fields of type `bytes` the compiler generates the `ProtoBytesCow` type
instead.

The compiler generates the following accessor methods:

*   `fn foo(&self) -> &ProtoStr`: Returns the current value of the field. If the
    field is not set, returns the empty string/empty bytes.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, value: impl IntoProxied<ProtoString>)`: Sets the
    field to `value`.

#### Enum Fields {#implicit-presence-enum}

Given the enum type:

```proto
enum Bar {
  BAR_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  BAR_VALUE = 1;
  BAR_OTHER_VALUE = 2;
}
```

The compiler generates a struct where each variant is an associated constant:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
#[repr(transparent)]
pub struct Bar(i32);

impl Bar {
  pub const Unspecified: Bar = Bar(0);
  pub const Value: Bar = Bar(1);
  pub const OtherValue: Bar = Bar(2);
}
```

For these field definitions:

```proto
// proto3
Bar foo = 1;

// editions
message MyMessage {
 Bar foo = 1 [features.field_presence = IMPLICIT];
}
```

The compiler will generate the following accessor methods:

*   `fn foo(&self) -> Bar`: Returns the current value of the field. If the field
    is not set, it returns the default value.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, value: Bar)`: Sets the value of the field. After
    calling this, `has_foo()` will return `true` and `foo()` will return
    `value`.

### Repeated Fields {#repeated-fields}

For any repeated field definition the compiler will generate the same three
accessor methods that deviate only in the field type.

In editions, you can control the wire format encoding of repeated primitive
fields using the
[`repeated_field_encoding`](/editions/features#repeated_field_encoding)
feature.

```proto
// proto2
repeated int32 foo = 1; // EXPANDED by default

// proto3
repeated int32 foo = 1; // PACKED by default

// editions
repeated int32 foo = 1 [features.repeated_field_encoding = PACKED];
repeated int32 bar = 2 [features.repeated_field_encoding = EXPANDED];
```

Given any of the above field definitions, the compiler generates the following
accessor methods:

*   `fn foo(&self) -> RepeatedView<'_, i32>`: Returns a view of the underlying
    repeated field.
*   `fn foo_mut(&mut self) -> RepeatedMut<'_, i32>`: Returns a mutable handle to
    the underlying repeated field.
*   `fn set_foo(&mut self, src: impl IntoProxied<Repeated<i32>>)`: Sets the
    underlying repeated field to a new repeated field provided in `src`.

For different field types only the respective generic types of the
`RepeatedView`, `RepeatedMut` and `Repeated` types will change. For example,
given a field of type `string` the `foo()` accessor would return a
`RepeatedView<'_, ProtoString>`.

### Map Fields {#map}

For this map field definition:

```proto
map<int32, int32> weight = 1;
```

The compiler will generate the following 3 accessor methods:

*   `fn weight(&self) -> protobuf::MapView<'_, i32, i32>`: Returns an immutable
    view of the underlying map.
*   `fn weight_mut(&mut self) -> protobuf::MapMut<'_, i32, i32>`: Returns a
    mutable handle to the underlying map.
*   `fn set_weight(&mut self, src: protobuf::IntoProxied<Map<i32, i32>>)`: Sets
    the underlying map to `src`.

For different field types only the respective generic types of the `MapView`,
`MapMut` and `Map` types will change. For example, given a field of type
`string` the `foo()` accessor would return a `MapView<'_, int32, ProtoString>`.

## Any {#any}

Any is not special-cased by Rust Protobuf at this time; it will behave as though
it was a simple message with this definition:

```proto
message Any {
  string type_url = 1;
  bytes value = 2;
}
```

## Oneof {#oneof}

Given a oneof definition like this:

```proto
oneof example_name {
    int32 foo_int = 4;
    string foo_string = 9;
    ...
}
```

The compiler will generate accessors (getters, setters, hazzers) for every field
as if the same field was declared as an `optional` field outside of the oneof.
So you can work with oneof fields like regular fields, but setting one will
clear the other fields in the oneof block. In addition, the following types are
emitted for the `oneof` block:

```rust
  #[non_exhaustive]
  #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]

  pub enum ExampleNameOneof<'msg> {
    FooInt(i32) = 4,
    FooString(&'msg protobuf::ProtoStr) = 9,
    not_set(std::marker::PhantomData<&'msg ()>) = 0
  }
```

```rust
  #[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]

  pub enum ExampleNameCase {
    FooInt = 4,
    FooString = 9,
    not_set = 0
  }
```

Additionally, it will generate the two accessors:

*   `fn example_name(&self) -> ExampleNameOneof<_>`: Returns the enum variant
    indicating which field is set and the field's value. Returns `not_set` if no
    field is set.
*   `fn example_name_case(&self) -> ExampleNameCase`: Returns the enum variant
    indicating which field is set. Returns `not_set` if no field is set.

## Enumerations {#enumerations}

Given an enum definition like:

```proto
enum FooBar {
  FOO_BAR_UNKNOWN = 0;
  FOO_BAR_A = 1;
  FOO_B = 5;
  VALUE_C = 1234;
}
```

The compiler will generate:

```rust
  #[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
  #[repr(transparent)]
  pub struct FooBar(i32);

  impl FooBar {
    pub const Unknown: FooBar = FooBar(0);
    pub const A: FooBar = FooBar(1);
    pub const FooB: FooBar = FooBar(5);
    pub const ValueC: FooBar = FooBar(1234);
  }
```

Note that for values with a prefix that matches the enum, the prefix will be
stripped; this is done to improve ergonomics. Enum values are commonly prefixed
with the enum name to avoid name collisions between sibling enums (which follow
the semantics of C++ enums where the values are not scoped by their containing
enum). Since the generated Rust consts are scoped within the `impl`, the
additional prefix, which is beneficial to add in .proto files, would be
redundant in Rust.

## Extensions (proto2 only) {#extensions}

A Rust API for extensions is currently a work in progress.
Extension fields will be maintained through
parse/serialize, and in a C++ interop case any extensions set will be retained
if the message is accessed from Rust (and propagated in the case of a message
copy or merge).

## Arena Allocation {#arena}

A Rust API for arena allocated messages has not yet been implemented.

Internally, Protobuf Rust on upb kernel uses arenas, but on C++ kernels it
doesn't. However, references (both const and mutable) to messages that were
arena allocated in C++ can be safely passed to Rust to be accessed or mutated.

## Services {#services}

A Rust API for services has not yet been implemented.
