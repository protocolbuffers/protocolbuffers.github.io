---

This guide describes how to use the protocol buffer language to structure your
protocol buffer data, including `.proto` file syntax and how to generate data
access classes from your `.proto` files. It covers the **proto3** version of the
protocol buffers language: for information on the **proto2** syntax, see the
[Proto2 Language Guide](/programming-guides/proto).

This is a reference guide – for a step by step example that uses many of the
features described in this document, see the
[tutorial](/getting-started) for your chosen language.

## Defining A Message Type {#simple}

First let's look at a very simple example. Let's say you want to define a search
request message format, where each search request has a query string, the
particular page of results you are interested in, and a number of results per
page. Here's the `.proto` file you use to define the message type.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message SearchRequest {
  string query = 1;
  int32 page_number = 2;
  int32 result_per_page = 3;
}
```

*   The first line of the file specifies that you're using `proto3` syntax: if
    you don't do this the protocol buffer compiler will assume you are using
    [proto2](/programming-guides/proto). This must be the
    first non-empty, non-comment line of the file.
*   The `SearchRequest` message definition specifies three fields (name/value
    pairs), one for each piece of data that you want to include in this type of
    message. Each field has a name and a type.

### Specifying Field Types

In the above example, all the fields are [scalar types](#scalar): two integers
(`page_number` and `result_per_page`) and a string (`query`). However, you can
also specify composite types for your fields, including [enumerations](#enum)
and other message types.

### Assigning Field Numbers

As you can see, each field in the message definition has a **unique number**.
These field numbers are used to identify your fields in the
[message binary format](/programming-guides/encoding),
and should not be changed once your message type is in use. Note that field
numbers in the range 1 through 15 take one byte to encode, including the field
number and the field's type (you can find out more about this in
[Protocol Buffer Encoding](/programming-guides/encoding#structure)).
Field numbers in the range 16 through 2047 take two bytes. So you should reserve
the numbers 1 through 15 for very frequently occurring message elements.
Remember to leave some room for frequently occurring elements that might be
added in the future.

The smallest field number you can specify is 1, and the largest is
2<sup>28</sup> - 1, or 536,870,911\. You also cannot use the numbers 19000
through 19999 (`FieldDescriptor::kFirstReservedNumber` through
`FieldDescriptor::kLastReservedNumber`), as they are reserved for the Protocol
Buffers implementation—the protocol buffer compiler will complain if you use one
of these reserved numbers in your `.proto`. Similarly, you cannot use any
previously [reserved](#reserved) field numbers.

### Specifying Field Rules

Message fields can be one of the following:

*   `singular`: a well-formed message can have zero or one of this field (but
    not more than one). When using proto3 syntax, this is the default field rule
    when no other field rules are specified for a given field. You cannot
    determine whether it was parsed from the wire. It will be serialized to the
    wire unless it is the default value. For more on this subject, see
    [Field Presence](/programming-guides/field_presence).
*   `optional`: the same as `singular`, except that you can check to see if the
    value was explicitly set. An `optional` field is in one of two possible
    states:
    *   the field is set, and contains a value that was explicitly set or parsed
        from the wire. It will be serialized to the wire.
    *   the field is unset, and will return the default value. It will not be
        serialized to the wire.
*   `repeated`: this field type can be repeated zero or more times in a
    well-formed message. The order of the repeated values will be preserved.
*   `map`: this is a paired key/value field type. See
    [Maps](/programming-guides/encoding#maps) for more on
    this field type.

In proto3, `repeated` fields of scalar numeric types use `packed` encoding by
default. You can find out more about `packed` encoding in
[Protocol Buffer Encoding](/programming-guides/encoding#packed).

### Adding More Message Types

Multiple message types can be defined in a single `.proto` file. This is useful
if you are defining multiple related messages – so, for example, if you wanted
to define the reply message format that corresponds to your `SearchResponse`
message type, you could add it to the same `.proto`:

```proto
message SearchRequest {
  string query = 1;
  int32 page_number = 2;
  int32 result_per_page = 3;
}

message SearchResponse {
 ...
}
```

### Adding Comments

To add comments to your `.proto` files, use C/C++-style `//` and `/* ... */`
syntax.

```proto
/* SearchRequest represents a search query, with pagination options to
 * indicate which results to include in the response. */

message SearchRequest {
  string query = 1;
  int32 page_number = 2;  // Which page number do we want?
  int32 result_per_page = 3;  // Number of results to return per page.
}
```

### Reserved Fields {#reserved}

If you [update](#updating) a message type by entirely removing a field, or
commenting it out, future users can reuse the field number when making their own
updates to the type. This can cause severe issues if they later load old
versions of the same `.proto`, including data corruption, privacy bugs, and so
on. One way to make sure this doesn't happen is to specify that the field
numbers (and/or names, which can also cause issues for JSON serialization) of
your deleted fields are `reserved`. The protocol buffer compiler will complain
if any future users try to use these field identifiers.

```proto
message Foo {
  reserved 2, 15, 9 to 11;
  reserved "foo", "bar";
}
```

Note that you can't mix field names and field numbers in the same `reserved`
statement.

### What's Generated From Your `.proto`?

When you run the [protocol buffer compiler](#generating) on a `.proto`, the
compiler generates the code in your chosen language you'll need to work with the
message types you've described in the file, including getting and setting field
values, serializing your messages to an output stream, and parsing your messages
from an input stream.

*   For **C++**, the compiler generates a `.h` and `.cc` file from each
    `.proto`, with a class for each message type described in your file.
*   For **Java**, the compiler generates a `.java` file with a class for each
    message type, as well as a special `Builder` class for creating message
    class instances.
*   For **Kotlin**, in addition to the Java generated code, the compiler
    generates a `.kt` file for each message type, containing a DSL which can be
    used to simplify creating message instances.
*   **Python** is a little different — the Python compiler generates a module
    with a static descriptor of each message type in your `.proto`, which is
    then used with a *metaclass* to create the necessary Python data access
    class at runtime.
*   For **Go**, the compiler generates a `.pb.go` file with a type for each
    message type in your file.
*   For **Ruby**, the compiler generates a `.rb` file with a Ruby module
    containing your message types.
*   For **Objective-C**, the compiler generates a `pbobjc.h` and `pbobjc.m` file
    from each `.proto`, with a class for each message type described in your
    file.
*   For **C#**, the compiler generates a `.cs` file from each `.proto`, with a
    class for each message type described in your file.
*   For **Dart**, the compiler generates a `.pb.dart` file with a class for each
    message type in your file.

You can find out more about using the APIs for each language by following the
tutorial for your chosen language (proto3 versions coming soon). For even more
API details, see the relevant
[API reference](/reference/) (proto3 versions also coming
soon).

</div>

You can find out more about how these types are encoded when you serialize your
message in
[Protocol Buffer Encoding](/programming-guides/encoding).

<sup>[1]</sup> Kotlin uses the corresponding types from Java, even for unsigned
types, to ensure compatibility in mixed Java/Kotlin codebases.

<sup>[2]</sup> In Java, unsigned 32-bit and 64-bit integers are represented
using their signed counterparts, with the top bit simply being stored in the
sign bit.

<sup>[3]</sup> In all cases, setting values to a field will perform type
checking to make sure it is valid.

<sup>[4]</sup> 64-bit or unsigned 32-bit integers are always represented as long
when decoded, but can be an int if an int is given when setting the field. In
all cases, the value must fit in the type represented when set. See [2].

<sup>[5]</sup> Python strings are represented as unicode on decode but can be
str if an ASCII string is given (this is subject to change).

<sup>[6]</sup> Integer is used on 64-bit machines and string is used on 32-bit
machines.

## Default Values {#default}

When a message is parsed, if the encoded message does not contain a particular
singular element, the corresponding field in the parsed object is set to the
default value for that field. These defaults are type-specific:

*   For strings, the default value is the empty string.
*   For bytes, the default value is empty bytes.
*   For bools, the default value is false.
*   For numeric types, the default value is zero.
*   For [enums](#enum), the default value is the **first defined enum value**,
    which must be 0.
*   For message fields, the field is not set. Its exact value is
    language-dependent. See the
    [generated code guide](/reference/) for details.

The default value for repeated fields is empty (generally an empty list in the
appropriate language).

Note that for scalar message fields, once a message is parsed there's no way of
telling whether a field was explicitly set to the default value (for example
whether a boolean was set to `false`) or just not set at all: you should bear
this in mind when defining your message types. For example, don't have a boolean
that switches on some behavior when set to `false` if you don't want that
behavior to also happen by default. Also note that if a scalar message field
**is** set to its default, the value will not be serialized on the wire.

See the [generated code guide](/reference/) for your
chosen language for more details about how defaults work in generated code.

## Enumerations {#enum}

When you're defining a message type, you might want one of its fields to only
have one of a pre-defined list of values. For example, let's say you want to add
a `corpus` field for each `SearchRequest`, where the corpus can be `UNIVERSAL`,
`WEB`, `IMAGES`, `LOCAL`, `NEWS`, `PRODUCTS` or `VIDEO`. You can do this very
simply by adding an `enum` to your message definition with a constant for each
possible value.

In the following example we've added an `enum` called `Corpus` with all the
possible values, and a field of type `Corpus`:

```proto
enum Corpus {
  CORPUS_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  CORPUS_UNIVERSAL = 1;
  CORPUS_WEB = 2;
  CORPUS_IMAGES = 3;
  CORPUS_LOCAL = 4;
  CORPUS_NEWS = 5;
  CORPUS_PRODUCTS = 6;
  CORPUS_VIDEO = 7;
}

message SearchRequest {
  string query = 1;
  int32 page_number = 2;
  int32 result_per_page = 3;
  Corpus corpus = 4;
}
```

As you can see, the `Corpus` enum's first constant maps to zero: every enum
definition **must** contain a constant that maps to zero as its first element.
This is because:

*   There must be a zero value, so that we can use 0 as a numeric
    [default value](#default).
*   The zero value needs to be the first element, for compatibility with the
    [proto2](/programming-guides/proto) semantics where
    the first enum value is always the default.

You can define aliases by assigning the same value to different enum constants.
To do this you need to set the `allow_alias` option to `true`, otherwise the
protocol compiler generates a warning message when aliases are found.
Though all alias values are valid during deserialization, the first value is
always used when serializing.

```proto
enum EnumAllowingAlias {
  option allow_alias = true;
  EAA_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  EAA_STARTED = 1;
  EAA_RUNNING = 1;
  EAA_FINISHED = 2;
}

enum EnumNotAllowingAlias {
  ENAA_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  ENAA_STARTED = 1;
  // ENAA_RUNNING = 1;  // Uncommenting this line will cause a warning message.
  ENAA_FINISHED = 2;
}
```

Enumerator constants must be in the range of a 32-bit integer. Since `enum`
values use
[varint encoding](/programming-guides/encoding) on the
wire, negative values are inefficient and thus not recommended. You can define
`enum`s within a message definition, as in the above example, or outside – these
`enum`s can be reused in any message definition in your `.proto` file. You can
also use an `enum` type declared in one message as the type of a field in a
different message, using the syntax `_MessageType_._EnumType_`.

When you run the protocol buffer compiler on a `.proto` that uses an `enum`, the
generated code will have a corresponding `enum` for Java, Kotlin, or C++, or a
special `EnumDescriptor` class for Python that's used to create a set of
symbolic constants with integer values in the runtime-generated class.

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}} The
generated code may be subject to language-specific limitations on the number of
enumerators (low thousands for one language). Review the limitations for the
languages you plan to use. {{% /alert %}}

During deserialization, unrecognized enum values will be preserved in the
message, though how this is represented when the message is deserialized is
language-dependent. In languages that support open enum types with values
outside the range of specified symbols, such as C++ and Go, the unknown enum
value is simply stored as its underlying integer representation. In languages
with closed enum types such as Java, a case in the enum is used to represent an
unrecognized value, and the underlying integer can be accessed with special
accessors. In either case, if the message is serialized the unrecognized value
will still be serialized with the message.

information on how enums should work contrasted with how they currently work in
different languages, see
[Enum Behavior](/programming-guides/enum).
{{% /alert %}}

For more information about how to work with message `enum`s in your
applications, see the [generated code guide](/reference/)
for your chosen language.

### Reserved Values

If you [update](#updating) an enum type by entirely removing an enum entry, or
commenting it out, future users can reuse the numeric value when making their
own updates to the type. This can cause severe issues if they later load old
versions of the same `.proto`, including data corruption, privacy bugs, and so
on. One way to make sure this doesn't happen is to specify that the numeric
values (and/or names, which can also cause issues for JSON serialization) of
your deleted entries are `reserved`. The protocol buffer compiler will complain
if any future users try to use these identifiers. You can specify that your
reserved numeric value range goes up to the maximum possible value using the
`max` keyword.

```proto
enum Foo {
  reserved 2, 15, 9 to 11, 40 to max;
  reserved "FOO", "BAR";
}
```

Note that you can't mix field names and numeric values in the same `reserved`
statement.

## Using Other Message Types {#other}

You can use other message types as field types. For example, let's say you
wanted to include `Result` messages in each `SearchResponse` message – to do
this, you can define a `Result` message type in the same `.proto` and then
specify a field of type `Result` in `SearchResponse`:

```proto
message SearchResponse {
  repeated Result results = 1;
}

message Result {
  string url = 1;
  string title = 2;
  repeated string snippets = 3;
}
```

### Importing Definitions

In the above example, the `Result` message type is defined in the same file as
`SearchResponse` – what if the message type you want to use as a field type is
already defined in another `.proto` file?

You can use definitions from other `.proto` files by *importing* them. To import
another `.proto`'s definitions, you add an import statement to the top of your
file:

```proto
import "myproject/other_protos.proto";
```

By default, you can use definitions only from directly imported `.proto` files.
However, sometimes you may need to move a `.proto` file to a new location.
Instead of moving the `.proto` file directly and updating all the call sites in
a single change, you can put a placeholder `.proto` file in the old location to
forward all the imports to the new location using the `import public` notion.

**Note that the public import functionality is not available in Java.**

`import public` dependencies can be transitively relied upon by any code
importing the proto containing the `import public` statement. For example:

```proto
// new.proto
// All definitions are moved here
```

```proto
// old.proto
// This is the proto that all clients are importing.
import public "new.proto";
import "other.proto";
```

```proto
// client.proto
import "old.proto";
// You use definitions from old.proto and new.proto, but not other.proto
```

The protocol compiler searches for imported files in a set of directories
specified on the protocol compiler command line using the `-I`/`--proto_path`
flag. If no flag was given, it looks in the directory in which the compiler was
invoked. In general you should set the `--proto_path` flag to the root of your
project and use fully qualified names for all imports.

### Using proto2 Message Types

It's possible to import
[proto2](/programming-guides/proto) message types and use
them in your proto3 messages, and vice versa. However, proto2 enums cannot be
used directly in proto3 syntax (it's okay if an imported proto2 message uses
them).

## Nested Types {#nested}

You can define and use message types inside other message types, as in the
following example – here the `Result` message is defined inside the
`SearchResponse` message:

```proto
message SearchResponse {
  message Result {
    string url = 1;
    string title = 2;
    repeated string snippets = 3;
  }
  repeated Result results = 1;
}
```

If you want to reuse this message type outside its parent message type, you
refer to it as `_Parent_._Type_`:

```proto
message SomeOtherMessage {
  SearchResponse.Result result = 1;
}
```

You can nest messages as deeply as you like:

```proto
message Outer {                  // Level 0
  message MiddleAA {  // Level 1
    message Inner {   // Level 2
      int64 ival = 1;
      bool  booly = 2;
    }
  }
  message MiddleBB {  // Level 1
    message Inner {   // Level 2
      int32 ival = 1;
      bool  booly = 2;
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating A Message Type {#updating}

If an existing message type no longer meets all your needs – for example, you'd
like the message format to have an extra field – but you'd still like to use
code created with the old format, don't worry! It's very simple to update
message types without breaking any of your existing code. Just remember the
following rules:

*   Don't change the field numbers for any existing fields.
*   If you add new fields, any messages serialized by code using your "old"
    message format can still be parsed by your new generated code. You should
    keep in mind the [default values](#default) for these elements so that new
    code can properly interact with messages generated by old code. Similarly,
    messages created by your new code can be parsed by your old code: old
    binaries simply ignore the new field when parsing. See the
    [Unknown Fields](#unknowns) section for details.
*   Fields can be removed, as long as the field number is not used again in your
    updated message type. You may want to rename the field instead, perhaps
    adding the prefix "OBSOLETE_", or make the field number
    [reserved](#reserved), so that future users of your `.proto` can't
    accidentally reuse the number.
*   `int32`, `uint32`, `int64`, `uint64`, and `bool` are all compatible – this
    means you can change a field from one of these types to another without
    breaking forwards- or backwards-compatibility. If a number is parsed from
    the wire which doesn't fit in the corresponding type, you will get the same
    effect as if you had cast the number to that type in C++ (for example, if a
    64-bit number is read as an int32, it will be truncated to 32 bits).
*   `sint32` and `sint64` are compatible with each other but are *not*
    compatible with the other integer types.
*   `string` and `bytes` are compatible as long as the bytes are valid UTF-8.
*   Embedded messages are compatible with `bytes` if the bytes contain an
    encoded version of the message.
*   `fixed32` is compatible with `sfixed32`, and `fixed64` with `sfixed64`.
*   For `string`, `bytes`, and message fields, `optional` is compatible with
    `repeated`. Given serialized data of a repeated field as input, clients that
    expect this field to be `optional` will take the last input value if it's a
    primitive type field or merge all input elements if it's a message type
    field. Note that this is **not** generally safe for numeric types, including
    bools and enums. Repeated fields of numeric types can be serialized in the
    [packed](/programming-guides/encoding#packed) format,
    which will not be parsed correctly when an `optional` field is expected.
*   `enum` is compatible with `int32`, `uint32`, `int64`, and `uint64` in terms
    of wire format (note that values will be truncated if they don't fit).
    However be aware that client code may treat them differently when the
    message is deserialized: for example, unrecognized proto3 `enum` types will
    be preserved in the message, but how this is represented when the message is
    deserialized is language-dependent. Int fields always just preserve their
    value.
*   Changing a single `optional` field or extension into a member of a **new**
    `oneof` is binary compatible, however for some languages (notably, Go) the
    generated code's API will change in incompatible ways. For this reason,
    Google does not make such changes in its public APIs, as documented in
    [AIP-180](https://google.aip.dev/180#moving-into-oneofs). With
    the same caveat about source-compatibility, moving multiple fields into a
    new `oneof` may be safe if you are sure that no code sets more than one at a
    time. Moving fields into an existing `oneof` is not safe. Likewise, changing
    a single field `oneof` to an `optional` field or extension is safe.

## Unknown Fields {#unknowns}

Unknown fields are well-formed protocol buffer serialized data representing
fields that the parser does not recognize. For example, when an old binary
parses data sent by a new binary with new fields, those new fields become
unknown fields in the old binary.

Originally, proto3 messages always discarded unknown fields during parsing, but
in version 3.5 we reintroduced the preservation of unknown fields to match the
proto2 behavior. In versions 3.5 and later, unknown fields are retained during
parsing and included in the serialized output.

## Any {#any}

The `Any` message type lets you use messages as embedded types without having
their .proto definition. An `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized message as
`bytes`, along with a URL that acts as a globally unique identifier for and
resolves to that message's type. To use the `Any` type, you need to
[import](#other) `google/protobuf/any.proto`.

```proto
import "google/protobuf/any.proto";

message ErrorStatus {
  string message = 1;
  repeated google.protobuf.Any details = 2;
}
```

The default type URL for a given message type is
`type.googleapis.com/_packagename_._messagename_`.

Different language implementations will support runtime library helpers to pack
and unpack `Any` values in a typesafe manner – for example, in Java, the `Any`
type will have special `pack()` and `unpack()` accessors, while in C++ there are
`PackFrom()` and `UnpackTo()` methods:

```c++
// Storing an arbitrary message type in Any.
NetworkErrorDetails details = ...;
ErrorStatus status;
status.add_details()->PackFrom(details);

// Reading an arbitrary message from Any.
ErrorStatus status = ...;
for (const google::protobuf::Any& detail : status.details()) {
  if (detail.Is<NetworkErrorDetails>()) {
    NetworkErrorDetails network_error;
    detail.UnpackTo(&network_error);
    ... processing network_error ...
  }
}
```

**Currently the runtime libraries for working with `Any` types are under
development**.

If you are already familiar with
[proto2 syntax](/programming-guides/proto), the `Any` can
hold arbitrary proto3 messages, similar to proto2 messages which can allow
[extensions](/programming-guides/proto#extensions).

## Oneof {#oneof}

If you have a message with many fields and where at most one field will be set
at the same time, you can enforce this behavior and save memory by using the
oneof feature.

Oneof fields are like regular fields except all the fields in a oneof share
memory, and at most one field can be set at the same time. Setting any member of
the oneof automatically clears all the other members. You can check which value
in a oneof is set (if any) using a special `case()` or `WhichOneof()` method,
depending on your chosen language.

Note that if *multiple values are set, the last set value as determined by the
order in the proto will overwrite all previous ones*.

### Using Oneof

To define a oneof in your `.proto` you use the `oneof` keyword followed by your
oneof name, in this case `test_oneof`:

```proto
message SampleMessage {
  oneof test_oneof {
    string name = 4;
    SubMessage sub_message = 9;
  }
}
```

You then add your oneof fields to the oneof definition. You can add fields of
any type, except `map` fields and `repeated` fields.

In your generated code, oneof fields have the same getters and setters as
regular fields. You also get a special method for checking which value (if any)
in the oneof is set. You can find out more about the oneof API for your chosen
language in the relevant [API reference](/reference/).

### Oneof Features

*   Setting a oneof field will automatically clear all other members of the
    oneof. So if you set several oneof fields, only the *last* field you set
    will still have a value.

    ```c++
    SampleMessage message;
    message.set_name("name");
    CHECK_EQ(message.name(), "name");
    // Calling mutable_sub_message() will clear the name field and will set
    // sub_message to a new instance of SubMessage with none of its fields set.
    message.mutable_sub_message();
    CHECK(message.name().empty());
    ```

*   If the parser encounters multiple members of the same oneof on the wire,
    only the last member seen is used in the parsed message.

*   A oneof cannot be `repeated`.

*   Reflection APIs work for oneof fields.

*   If you set a oneof field to the default value (such as setting an int32
    oneof field to 0), the "case" of that oneof field will be set, and the value
    will be serialized on the wire.

*   If you're using C++, make sure your code doesn't cause memory crashes. The
    following sample code will crash because `sub_message` was already deleted
    by calling the `set_name()` method.

    ```c++
    SampleMessage message;
    SubMessage* sub_message = message.mutable_sub_message();
    message.set_name("name");      // Will delete sub_message
    sub_message->set_...            // Crashes here
    ```

*   Again in C++, if you `Swap()` two messages with oneofs, each message will
    end up with the other’s oneof case: in the example below, `msg1` will have a
    `sub_message` and `msg2` will have a `name`.

    ```c++
    SampleMessage msg1;
    msg1.set_name("name");
    SampleMessage msg2;
    msg2.mutable_sub_message();
    msg1.swap(&msg2);
    CHECK(msg1.has_sub_message());
    CHECK_EQ(msg2.name(), "name");
    ```

### Backwards-compatibility issues

Be careful when adding or removing oneof fields. If checking the value of a
oneof returns `None`/`NOT_SET`, it could mean that the oneof has not been set or
it has been set to a field in a different version of the oneof. There is no way
to tell the difference, since there's no way to know if an unknown field on the
wire is a member of the oneof.

#### Tag Reuse Issues

*   **Move fields into or out of a oneof**: You may lose some of your
    information (some fields will be cleared) after the message is serialized
    and parsed. However, you can safely move a single field into a **new** oneof
    and may be able to move multiple fields if it is known that only one is ever
    set. See [Updating A Message Type](#updating) for further details.
*   **Delete a oneof field and add it back**: This may clear your currently set
    oneof field after the message is serialized and parsed.
*   **Split or merge oneof**: This has similar issues to moving regular fields.

## Maps {#maps}

If you want to create an associative map as part of your data definition,
protocol buffers provides a handy shortcut syntax:

```proto
map<key_type, value_type> map_field = N;
```

...where the `key_type` can be any integral or string type (so, any
[scalar](#scalar) type except for floating point types and `bytes`). Note that
enum is not a valid `key_type`. The `value_type` can be any type except another
map.

So, for example, if you wanted to create a map of projects where each `Project`
message is associated with a string key, you could define it like this:

```proto
map<string, Project> projects = 3;
```

*   Map fields cannot be `repeated`.
*   Wire format ordering and map iteration ordering of map values are undefined,
    so you cannot rely on your map items being in a particular order.
*   When generating text format for a `.proto`, maps are sorted by key. Numeric
    keys are sorted numerically.
*   When parsing from the wire or when merging, if there are duplicate map keys
    the last key seen is used. When parsing a map from text format, parsing may
    fail if there are duplicate keys.
*   If you provide a key but no value for a map field, the behavior when the
    field is serialized is language-dependent. In C++, Java, Kotlin, and Python
    the default value for the type is serialized, while in other languages
    nothing is serialized.

The generated map API is currently available for all proto3 supported languages.
You can find out more about the map API for your chosen language in the relevant
[API reference](/reference/).

### Backwards Compatibility

The map syntax is equivalent to the following on the wire, so protocol buffers
implementations that do not support maps can still handle your data:

```proto
message MapFieldEntry {
  key_type key = 1;
  value_type value = 2;
}

repeated MapFieldEntry map_field = N;
```

Any protocol buffers implementation that supports maps must both produce and
accept data that can be accepted by the above definition.

## Packages {#packages}

You can add an optional `package` specifier to a `.proto` file to prevent name
clashes between protocol message types.

```proto
package foo.bar;
message Open { ... }
```

You can then use the package specifier when defining fields of your message
type:

```proto
message Foo {
  ...
  foo.bar.Open open = 1;
  ...
}
```

The way a package specifier affects the generated code depends on your chosen
language:

*   In **C++** the generated classes are wrapped inside a C++ namespace. For
    example, `Open` would be in the namespace `foo::bar`.
*   In **Java** and **Kotlin**, the package is used as the Java package, unless
    you explicitly provide an `option java_package` in your `.proto` file.
*   In **Python**, the package directive is ignored, since Python modules are
    organized according to their location in the file system.
*   In **Go**, the package is used as the Go package name, unless you explicitly
    provide an `option go_package` in your `.proto` file.
*   In **Ruby**, the generated classes are wrapped inside nested Ruby
    namespaces, converted to the required Ruby capitalization style (first
    letter capitalized; if the first character is not a letter, `PB_` is
    prepended). For example, `Open` would be in the namespace `Foo::Bar`.
*   In **C#** the package is used as the namespace after converting to
    PascalCase, unless you explicitly provide an `option csharp_namespace` in
    your `.proto` file. For example, `Open` would be in the namespace `Foo.Bar`.

### Packages and Name Resolution

Type name resolution in the protocol buffer language works like C++: first the
innermost scope is searched, then the next-innermost, and so on, with each
package considered to be "inner" to its parent package. A leading '.' (for
example, `.foo.bar.Baz`) means to start from the outermost scope instead.

The protocol buffer compiler resolves all type names by parsing the imported
`.proto` files. The code generator for each language knows how to refer to each
type in that language, even if it has different scoping rules.

## Defining Services {#services}

If you want to use your message types with an RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
system, you can define an RPC service interface in a `.proto` file and the
protocol buffer compiler will generate service interface code and stubs in your
chosen language. So, for example, if you want to define an RPC service with a
method that takes your `SearchRequest` and returns a `SearchResponse`, you can
define it in your `.proto` file as follows:

```proto
service SearchService {
  rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (SearchResponse);
}
```

The most straightforward RPC system to use with protocol buffers is
[gRPC](https://grpc.io): a language- and platform-neutral open source RPC system
developed at Google. gRPC works particularly well with protocol buffers and lets
you generate the relevant RPC code directly from your `.proto` files using a
special protocol buffer compiler plugin.

If you don't want to use gRPC, it's also possible to use protocol buffers with
your own RPC implementation. You can find out more about this in the
[Proto2 Language Guide](/programming-guides/proto#services).

There are also a number of ongoing third-party projects to develop RPC
implementations for Protocol Buffers. For a list of links to projects we know
about, see the
[third-party add-ons wiki page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/docs/third_party.md).

## JSON Mapping {#json}

Proto3 supports a canonical encoding in JSON, making it easier to share data
between systems. The encoding is described on a type-by-type basis in the table
below.

When parsing JSON-encoded data into a protocol buffer, if a value is missing or
if its value is `null`, it will be interpreted as the corresponding
[default value](#default).

When generating JSON-encoded output from a protocol buffer, if a protobuf field
has the default value and if the field doesn't support field presence, it will
be omitted from the output by default. An implementation may provide options to
include fields with default values in the output.

A proto3 field that is defined with the `optional` keyword supports field
presence. Fields that have a value set and that support field presence always
include the field value in the JSON-encoded output, even if it is the default
value.

### JSON Options

A proto3 JSON implementation may provide the following options:

*   **Emit fields with default values**: Fields with default values are omitted
    by default in proto3 JSON output. An implementation may provide an option to
    override this behavior and output fields with their default values.
*   **Ignore unknown fields**: Proto3 JSON parser should reject unknown fields
    by default but may provide an option to ignore unknown fields in parsing.
*   **Use proto field name instead of lowerCamelCase name**: By default proto3
    JSON printer should convert the field name to lowerCamelCase and use that as
    the JSON name. An implementation may provide an option to use proto field
    name as the JSON name instead. Proto3 JSON parsers are required to accept
    both the converted lowerCamelCase name and the proto field name.
*   **Emit enum values as integers instead of strings**: The name of an enum
    value is used by default in JSON output. An option may be provided to use
    the numeric value of the enum value instead.

## Options {#options}

Individual declarations in a `.proto` file can be annotated with a number of
*options*. Options do not change the overall meaning of a declaration, but may
affect the way it is handled in a particular context. The complete list of
available options is defined in [`/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto).

Some options are file-level options, meaning they should be written at the
top-level scope, not inside any message, enum, or service definition. Some
options are message-level options, meaning they should be written inside message
definitions. Some options are field-level options, meaning they should be
written inside field definitions. Options can also be written on enum types,
enum values, oneof fields, service types, and service methods; however, no
useful options currently exist for any of these.

Here are a few of the most commonly used options:

*   `java_package` (file option): The package you want to use for your generated
    Java/Kotlin classes. If no explicit `java_package` option is given in the
    `.proto` file, then by default the proto package (specified using the
    "package" keyword in the `.proto` file) will be used. However, proto
    packages generally do not make good Java packages since proto packages are
    not expected to start with reverse domain names. If not generating Java or
    Kotlin code, this option has no effect.

    ```proto
    option java_package = "com.example.foo";
    ```

*   `java_outer_classname` (file option): The class name (and hence the file
    name) for the wrapper Java class you want to generate. If no explicit
    `java_outer_classname` is specified in the `.proto` file, the class name
    will be constructed by converting the `.proto` file name to camel-case (so
    `foo_bar.proto` becomes `FooBar.java`). If the `java_multiple_files` option
    is disabled, then all other classes/enums/etc. generated for the `.proto`
    file will be generated *within* this outer wrapper Java class as nested
    classes/enums/etc. If not generating Java code, this option has no effect.

    ```proto
    option java_outer_classname = "Ponycopter";
    ```

*   `java_multiple_files` (file option): If false, only a single `.java` file
    will be generated for this `.proto` file, and all the Java
    classes/enums/etc. generated for the top-level messages, services, and
    enumerations will be nested inside of an outer class (see
    `java_outer_classname`). If true, separate `.java` files will be generated
    for each of the Java classes/enums/etc. generated for the top-level
    messages, services, and enumerations, and the wrapper Java class generated
    for this `.proto` file won't contain any nested classes/enums/etc. This is a
    Boolean option which defaults to `false`. If not generating Java code, this
    option has no effect.

    ```proto
    option java_multiple_files = true;
    ```

*   `optimize_for` (file option): Can be set to `SPEED`, `CODE_SIZE`, or
    `LITE_RUNTIME`. This affects the C++ and Java code generators (and possibly
    third-party generators) in the following ways:

    *   `SPEED` (default): The protocol buffer compiler will generate code for
        serializing, parsing, and performing other common operations on your
        message types. This code is highly optimized.
    *   `CODE_SIZE`: The protocol buffer compiler will generate minimal classes
        and will rely on shared, reflection-based code to implement
        serialialization, parsing, and various other operations. The generated
        code will thus be much smaller than with `SPEED`, but operations will be
        slower. Classes will still implement exactly the same public API as they
        do in `SPEED` mode. This mode is most useful in apps that contain a very
        large number of `.proto` files and do not need all of them to be
        blindingly fast.
    *   `LITE_RUNTIME`: The protocol buffer compiler will generate classes that
        depend only on the "lite" runtime library (`libprotobuf-lite` instead of
        `libprotobuf`). The lite runtime is much smaller than the full library
        (around an order of magnitude smaller) but omits certain features like
        descriptors and reflection. This is particularly useful for apps running
        on constrained platforms like mobile phones. The compiler will still
        generate fast implementations of all methods as it does in `SPEED` mode.
        Generated classes will only implement the `MessageLite` interface in
        each language, which provides only a subset of the methods of the full
        `Message` interface.

    ```proto
    option optimize_for = CODE_SIZE;
    ```

*   `cc_enable_arenas` (file option): Enables
    [arena allocation](/reference/cpp/arenas) for C++
    generated code.

*   `objc_class_prefix` (file option): Sets the Objective-C class prefix which
    is prepended to all Objective-C generated classes and enums from this
    .proto. There is no default. You should use prefixes that are between 3-5
    uppercase characters as
    [recommended by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Conventions/Conventions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH10-SW4).
    Note that all 2 letter prefixes are reserved by Apple.

*   `deprecated` (field option): If set to `true`, indicates that the field is
    deprecated and should not be used by new code. In most languages this has no
    actual effect. In Java, this becomes a `@Deprecated` annotation. For C++,
    clang-tidy will generate warnings whenever deprecated fields are used. In
    the future, other language-specific code generators may generate deprecation
    annotations on the field's accessors, which will in turn cause a warning to
    be emitted when compiling code which attempts to use the field. If the field
    is not used by anyone and you want to prevent new users from using it,
    consider replacing the field declaration with a [reserved](#reserved)
    statement.

    ```proto
    int32 old_field = 6 [deprecated = true];
    ```

### Custom Options {#customoptions}

Protocol Buffers also allows you to define and use your own options. This is an
**advanced feature** which most people don't need. If you do think you need to
create your own options, see the
[Proto2 Language Guide](/programming-guides/proto#customoptions)
for details. Note that creating custom options uses
[extensions](/programming-guides/proto#extensions), which
are permitted only for custom options in proto3.

### Option Retention {#option-retention}

Options have a notion of *retention*, which controls whether an option is
retained in the generated code. Options have *runtime retention* by default,
meaning that they are retained in the generated code and are thus visible at
runtime in the generated descriptor pool. However, you can set `retention =
RETENTION_SOURCE` to specify that an option (or field within an option) must not
be retained at runtime. This is called *source retention*.

Option retention is an advanced feature that most users should not need to worry
about, but it can be useful if you would like to use certain options without
paying the code size cost of retaining them in your binaries. Options with
source retention are still visible to `protoc` and `protoc` plugins, so code
generators can use them to customize their behavior.

Retention can be set directly on an option, like this;

```proto
extend google.protobuf.FileOptions {
  optional int32 source_retention_option = 1234
      [retention = RETENTION_SOURCE];
}
```

It can also be set on a plain field, in which case it takes effect only when
that field appears inside an option:

```proto
message OptionsMessage {
  optional int32 source_retention_field = 1 [retention = RETENTION_SOURCE];
}
```

You can set `retention = RETENTION_RUNTIME` if you like, but this has no effect
since it is the default behavior. When a message field is marked
`RETENTION_SOURCE`, its entire contents are dropped; fields inside it cannot
override that by trying to set `RETENTION_RUNTIME`.

of Protocol Buffers 22.0, support for option retention is still in progress and
only C++ and Java are supported. In all other languages, options are always
retained at runtime. {{% /alert %}}

## Generating Your Classes {#generating}

To generate the Java, Kotlin, Python, C++, Go, Ruby, Objective-C, or C# code you
need to work with the message types defined in a `.proto` file, you need to run
the protocol buffer compiler `protoc` on the `.proto`. If you haven't installed
the compiler, [download the package](/downloads) and
follow the instructions in the README. For Go, you also need to install a
special code generator plugin for the compiler: you can find this and
installation instructions in the
[golang/protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf/) repository on GitHub.

The Protocol Compiler is invoked as follows:

```sh
protoc --proto_path=IMPORT_PATH --cpp_out=DST_DIR --java_out=DST_DIR --python_out=DST_DIR --go_out=DST_DIR --ruby_out=DST_DIR --objc_out=DST_DIR --csharp_out=DST_DIR path/to/file.proto
```

*   `IMPORT_PATH` specifies a directory in which to look for `.proto` files when
    resolving `import` directives. If omitted, the current directory is used.
    Multiple import directories can be specified by passing the `--proto_path`
    option multiple times; they will be searched in order. `-I=_IMPORT_PATH_`
    can be used as a short form of `--proto_path`.
*   You can provide one or more *output directives*:

    *   `--cpp_out` generates C++ code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [C++ generated code reference](/reference/cpp/cpp-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--java_out` generates Java code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [Java generated code reference](/reference/java/java-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--kotlin_out` generates additional Kotlin code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [Kotlin generated code reference](/reference/kotlin/kotlin-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--python_out` generates Python code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [Python generated code reference](/reference/python/python-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--go_out` generates Go code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [Go generated code reference](/reference/go/go-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--ruby_out` generates Ruby code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [Ruby generated code reference](/reference/ruby/ruby-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--objc_out` generates Objective-C code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [Objective-C generated code reference](/reference/objective-c/objective-c-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--csharp_out` generates C# code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [C# generated code reference](/reference/csharp/csharp-generated)
        for more.
    *   `--php_out` generates PHP code in `DST_DIR`. See the
        [PHP generated code reference](/reference/php/php-generated)
        for more.

    As an extra convenience, if the `DST_DIR` ends in `.zip` or `.jar`, the
    compiler will write the output to a single ZIP-format archive file with the
    given name. `.jar` outputs will also be given a manifest file as required by
    the Java JAR specification. Note that if the output archive already exists,
    it will be overwritten; the compiler is not smart enough to add files to an
    existing archive.

*   You must provide one or more `.proto` files as input. Multiple `.proto`
    files can be specified at once. Although the files are named relative to the
    current directory, each file must reside in one of the `IMPORT_PATH`s so
    that the compiler can determine its canonical name.

## File location {#location}

Prefer not to put `.proto` files in the same
directory as other language sources. Consider
creating a subpackage `proto` for `.proto` files, under the root package for
your project.

### Location Should be Language-agnostic {#location-language-agnostic}

When working with Java code, it's handy to put related `.proto` files in the
same directory as the Java source. However, if any non-Java code ever uses the
same protos, the path prefix will no longer make sense. So in
general, put the protos in a related language-agnostic directory such as
`//myteam/mypackage`.

The exception to this rule is when it's clear that the protos will be used only
in a Java context, such as for testing.
