Protobuf supports a canonical encoding in JSON, making it easier to share data
with systems that do not support the standard protobuf binary wire format.

This page specifies the format, but a number of additional edge cases which
define a conformant ProtoJSON parser are covered in the Protobuf Conformance
Test Suite and are not exhaustively detailed here.

# Non-goals of the Format {#non-goals}

## Cannot Represent Some JSON schemas {#non-goals-arbitrary-json-schema}

The ProtoJSON format is designed to be a JSON representation of schemas which
are expressible in the Protobuf schema language.

It may be possible to represent many pre-existing JSON schemas as a Protobuf
schema and parse it using ProtoJSON, but it is not designed to be able to
represent arbitrary JSON schemas.

For example, there is no way to express in Protobuf schema to write types that
may be common in JSON schemas like `number[][]` or `number|string`.

It is possible to use `google.protobuf.Struct` and `google.protobuf.Value` types
to allow arbitrary JSON to be parsed into a Protobuf schema, but these only
allow you to capture the values as schemaless unordered key-value maps.

## Not as efficient as the binary wire format {#non-goals-highly-efficient}

ProtoJSON Format is not as efficient as binary wire format and never will be.

The converter uses more CPU to encode and decode messages and (except in rare
cases) encoded messages consume more space.

## Does not have as good schema-evolution guarantees as binary wire format {#non-goals-optimal-schema-evolution}

ProtoJSON format does not support unknown fields, and it puts field and enum
value names into encoded messages which makes it much harder to change those
names later. Removing fields is a breaking change that will trigger a parsing
error.

See [JSON Wire Safety](#json-wire-safety) below for more details.

## Presence and default-values {#presence}

When generating JSON-encoded output from a protocol buffer, if a field supports
presence, serializers must emit the field value if and only if the corresponding
hasser would return true.

If the field doesn't support field presence and has the default value (for
example any empty repeated field) serializers should omit it from the output. An
implementation may provide options to include fields with default values in the
output.

## Null values {#null-values}

Serializers should not emit `null` values.

Parsers should accept `null` as a legal value for any field, with the behavior:

*   Any key validity checking should still occur (disallowing unknown fields)
*   The field should remain unset, as though it was not present in the input at
    all (hassers should still return false where applicable).

`null` values are not allowed within repeated fields.

`google.protobuf.NullValue` is a special exception to this behavior: `null` is
handled as a sentinel-present value for this type, and so a field of this type
must be handled by serializers and parsers under the standard presence behavior.
This behavior correspondingly allows `google.protobuf.Struct` and
`google.protobuf.Value` to losslessly round trip arbitrary JSON.

## Duplicate values {#duplicate-values}

Serializers must never serialize the same field multiple times, nor multiple
different cases in the same oneof in the same JSON object.

Parsers should accept the same field being duplicated, and the last value
provided should be retained. This also applies to "alternate spellings" of the
same field name.

If implementations cannot maintain the necessary information about field order
it is preferred to reject inputs with duplicate keys rather than have an
arbitrary value win. In some implementations maintaining field order of objects
may be impractical or infeasible, so it is strongly recommended that systems
avoid relying on specific behavior for duplicate fields in ProtoJSON where
possible.

## Out of range numeric values

When parsing a numeric value, if the number that is is parsed from the wire
doesn't fit in the corresponding type, the parser should coerce the value to the
appropriate type. This has the same behavior as a simple cast in C++ or Java
(for example, if a number larger than 2^32 is read as for an int32 field, it
will be truncated to 32 bits).

## ProtoJSON Wire Safety {#json-wire-safety}

When using ProtoJSON, only some schema changes are safe to make in a distributed
system. This contrasts with the same concepts applied to the
[the binary wire format](/programming-guides/editions#updating).

### JSON Wire-unsafe Changes {#wire-unsafe}

Wire-unsafe changes are schema changes that will break if you parse data that
was serialized using the old schema with a parser that is using the new schema
(or vice versa). You should almost never do this shape of schema change.

*   Changing a field to or from an extension of same number and type is not
    safe.
*   Changing a field between `string` and `bytes` is not safe.
*   Changing a field between a message type and `bytes` is not safe.
*   Changing any field from `optional` to `repeated` is not safe.
*   Changing a field between a `map<K, V>` and the corresponding `repeated`
    message field is not safe.
*   Moving fields into an existing `oneof` is not safe.

### JSON Wire-safe Changes {#wire-safe}

Wire-safe changes are ones where it is fully safe to evolve the schema in this
way without risk of data loss or new parse failures.

Note that nearly all wire-safe changes may be a breaking change to application
code. For example, adding a value to a preexisting enum would be a compilation
break for any code with an exhaustive switch on that enum. For that reason,
Google may avoid making some of these types of changes on public messages. The
AIPs contain guidance for which of these changes are safe to make there.

*   Changing a single `optional` field into a member of a **new** `oneof` is
    safe.
*   Changing a `oneof` which contains only one field to an `optional` field is
    safe.
*   Changing a field between any of `int32`, `sint32`, `sfixed32`, `fixed32` is
    safe.
*   Changing a field between any of `int64`, `sint64`, `sfixed64`, `fixed64` is
    safe.
*   Changing a field number is safe (as the field numbers are not used in the
    ProtoJSON format), but still strongly discouraged since it is very unsafe in
    the binary wire format.
*   Adding values to an enum is safe if the "Emit enum values as integers" is
    set on all relevant clients (see [options](#json-options))

### JSON Wire-compatible Changes (Conditionally safe) {#conditionally-safe}

Unlike wire-safe changes, wire-compatible means that the same data can be parsed
both before and after a given change. However, a client that reads it will get
lossy data under this shape of change. For example, changing an int32 to an
int64 is a compatible change, but if a value larger than INT32_MAX is written, a
client that reads it as an int32 will discard the high order bits.

You can make compatible changes to your schema only if you manage the roll out
to your system carefully. For example, you may change an int32 to an int64 but
ensure you continue to only write legal int32 values until the new schema is
deployed to all endpoints, and then start writing larger values after that.

#### Compatible But With Unknown Field Handling Problems {#compatible-ish}

Unlike the binary wire format, ProtoJSON implementations generally do not
propagate unknown fields. This means that adding to schemas is generally
compatible but will result in parse failures if a client using the old schema
observes the new content.

This means you can add to your schema, but you cannot safely start writing them
until you know the schema has been deployed to the relevant client or server (or
that the relevant clients set an Ignore Unknown Fields flag, discussed
[below](#json-options)).

*   Adding and removing fields is considered compatible with this caveat.
*   Removing enum values is considered compatible with this caveat.

#### Compatible But Potentially Lossy {#compatible-lossy}

*   Changing between any of the 32-bit integers (`int32`, `uint32`, `sint32`,
    `sfixed32`, `fixed32`) and any of the 64-bit integers ( `int64`, `uint64`,
    `sint64`, `sfixed32`) is a compatible change.
    *   If a number is parsed from the wire that doesn't fit in the
        corresponding type, you will get the same effect as if you had cast the
        number to that type in C++ (for example, if a 64-bit number is read as
        an int32, it will be truncated to 32 bits).
    *   Unlike binary wire format, `bool` is not compatible with integers.
    *   Note that the int64 types are quoted by default to avoid precision loss
        when handled as a double or JavaScript number, and the 32 bit types are
        unquoted by default. Conformant implementations will accept either case
        for all integer types, but nonconformant implementations may mishandle
        this case and not handle quoted int32s or unquoted int64s which may
        break under this change.
*   `enum` may be conditionally compatible with `string`
    *   If "enums-as-ints" flag is used by any client, then enums will instead
        be compatible with the integer types instead.

## RFC 3339 Clarification {#rfc3339}

[RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339) intends to declare a strict
subset of ISO-8601 format, and unfortunately some ambiguity was created since
RFC 3339 was published in 2002 and then ISO-8601 was subsequently revised
without any corresponding revisions of RFC 3339.

Most notably, ISO-8601-1988 contains this note:

> In date and time representations lower case characters may be used when upper
> case characters are not available.

It is ambiguous whether this note is suggesting that parsers should accept
lowercase letters in general, or if it is only suggesting that lowercase letters
may be used as a substitute in environments where uppercase cannot be
technically used. RFC 3339 contains a note that intends to clarify the
interpretation to be that lowercase letters should be accepted in general.

ISO-8601-2019 does not contain the corresponding note and is unambiguous that
lowercase letters are not allowed. This created some confusion for all libraries
that declare they support RFC 3339: today RFC 3339 declares it is a profile of
ISO-8601 but contains a note that is in reference to something that is no longer
in the latest ISO-8601 spec.

ProtoJSON spec takes the decision that the timestamp format is the stricter
definition of "RFC 3339 as a profile of ISO-8601-2019". Some Protobuf
implementations may be non-conformant by using a timestamp parsing
implementation that is implemented as "RFC 3339 as a profile of ISO-8601-1988,"
which will accept a few additional edge cases.

For consistent interoperability, parsers should only accept the stricter subset
format where possible. When using a non-conformant implementation that accepts
the laxer definition, strongly avoid relying on the additional edge cases being
accepted.

## JSON Options {#json-options}

A conformant protobuf JSON implementation may provide the following options:

*   **Always emit fields without presence**: Fields that don't support presence
    and that have their default value are omitted by default in JSON output (for
    example, an implicit presence integer with a 0 value, implicit presence
    string fields that are empty strings, and empty repeated and map fields). An
    implementation may provide an option to override this behavior and output
    fields with their default values.

    As of v25.x, the C++, Java, and Python implementations are nonconformant, as
    this flag affects proto2 `optional` fields but not proto3 `optional` fields.
    A fix is planned for a future release.

*   **Ignore unknown fields**: The protobuf JSON parser should reject unknown
    fields by default but may provide an option to ignore unknown fields in
    parsing.

*   **Use proto field name instead of lowerCamelCase name**: By default the
    protobuf JSON printer should convert the field name to lowerCamelCase and
    use that as the JSON name. An implementation may provide an option to use
    proto field name as the JSON name instead. Protobuf JSON parsers are
    required to accept both the converted lowerCamelCase name and the proto
    field name.

*   **Emit enum values as integers instead of strings**: The name of an enum
    value is used by default in JSON output. An option may be provided to use
    the numeric value of the enum value instead.
