description: "This topic explains how Protocol Buffers encodes data to files or to the wire."
---

This document describes the protocol buffer *wire format*, which defines the
details of how your message is sent on the wire and how much space it consumes
on disk. You probably don't need to understand this to use protocol buffers in
your application, but it's useful information for doing optimizations.

If you already know the concepts but want a reference, skip to the
[Condensed reference card](#cheat-sheet) section.

[Protoscope](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protoscope) is a very simple
language for describing snippets of the low-level wire format, which we'll use
to provide a visual reference for the encoding of various messages. Protoscope's
syntax consists of a sequence of *tokens* that each encode down to a specific
byte sequence.

For example, backticks denote a raw hex literal, like `` `70726f746f6275660a`
``. This encodes into the exact bytes denoted as hex in the literal. Quotes
denote UTF-8 strings, like `"Hello, Protobuf!"`. This literal is synonymous with
`` `48656c6c6f2c2050726f746f62756621` `` (which, if you observe closely, is
composed of ASCII bytes). We'll introduce more of the Protoscope language as we
discuss aspects of the wire format.

The Protoscope tool can also dump encoded protocol buffers as text. See
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protoscope/tree/main/testdata for examples.

## A Simple Message {#simple}

Let's say you have the following very simple message definition:

```proto
message Test1 {
  optional int32 a = 1;
}
```

In an application, you create a `Test1` message and set `a` to 150. You then
serialize the message to an output stream. If you were able to examine the
encoded message, you'd see three bytes:

```proto
08 96 01
```

So far, so small and numeric -- but what does it mean? If you use the Protoscope
tool to dump those bytes, you'd get something like `1: 150`. How does it know
this is the contents of the message?

## Base 128 Varints {#varints}

Variable-width integers, or *varints*, are at the core of the wire format. They
allow encoding unsigned 64-bit integers using anywhere between one and ten
bytes, with small values using fewer bytes.

Each byte in the varint has a *continuation bit* that indicates if the byte that
follows it is part of the varint. This is the *most significant bit* (MSB) of
the byte (sometimes also called the *sign bit*). The lower 7 bits are a payload;
the resulting integer is built by appending together the 7-bit payloads of its
constituent bytes.

So, for example, here is the number 1, encoded as `` `01` `` -- it's a single
byte, so the MSB is not set:

```proto
0000 0001
^ msb
```

And here is 150, encoded as `` `9601` `` -- this is a bit more complicated:

```proto
10010110 00000001
^ msb    ^ msb
```

How do you figure out that this is 150? First you drop the MSB from each byte,
as this is just there to tell us whether we've reached the end of the number (as
you can see, it's set in the first byte as there is more than one byte in the
varint). Then we concatenate the 7-bit payloads, and interpret it as a
little-endian, 64-bit unsigned integer:

```proto
10010110 00000001        // Original inputs.
 0010110  0000001        // Drop continuation bits.
 0000001  0010110        // Put into little-endian order.
 10010110                // Concatenate.
 128 + 16 + 4 + 2 = 150  // Interpret as integer.
```

Because varints are so crucial to protocol buffers, in protoscope syntax, we
refer to them as plain integers. `150` is the same as `` `9601` ``.

## Message Structure {#structure}

A protocol buffer message is a series of key-value pairs. The binary version of
a message just uses the field's number as the key -- the name and declared type
for each field can only be determined on the decoding end by referencing the
message type's definition (i.e. the `.proto` file). Protoscope does not have
access to this information, so it can only provide the field numbers.

When a message is encoded, each key-value pair is turned into a *record*
consisting of the field number, a wire type and a payload. The wire type tells
the parser how big the payload after it is. This allows old parsers to skip over
new fields they don't understand. This type of scheme is sometimes called
[Tag-Length-Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93length%E2%80%93value),
or TLV.

There are six wire types: `VARINT`, `I64`, `LEN`, `SGROUP`, `EGROUP`, and `I32`

ID  | Name   | Used For
--- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------
0   | VARINT | int32, int64, uint32, uint64, sint32, sint64, bool, enum
1   | I64    | fixed64, sfixed64, double
2   | LEN    | string, bytes, embedded messages, packed repeated fields
3   | SGROUP | group start (deprecated)
4   | EGROUP | group end (deprecated)
5   | I32    | fixed32, sfixed32, float

The "tag" of a record is encoded as a varint formed from the field number and
the wire type via the formula `(field_number << 3) | wire_type`. In other words,
after decoding the varint representing a field, the low 3 bits tell us the wire
type, and the rest of the integer tells us the field number.

Now let's look at our simple example again. You now know that the first number
in the stream is always a varint key, and here it's `` `08` ``, or (dropping the
MSB):

```proto
000 1000
```

You take the last three bits to get the wire type (0) and then right-shift by
three to get the field number (1). Protoscope represents a tag as an integer
followed by a colon and the wire type, so we can write the above bytes as
`1:VARINT`.

Because the wire type is 0, or `VARINT`, we know that we need to decode a varint
to get the payload. As we saw above, the bytes `` `9601` `` varint-decode to
150, giving us our record. We can write it in Protoscope as `1:VARINT 150`.

Protoscope can infer the type for a tag if there is whitespace after the `:`. It
does so by looking ahead at the next token and guessing what you meant (the
rules are documented in detail in
[Protoscope's language.txt](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protoscope/blob/main/language.txt)).
For example, in `1: 150`, there is a varint immediately after the untyped tag,
so Protoscope infers its type to be `VARINT`. If you wrote `2: {}`, it would see
the `{` and guess `LEN`; if you wrote `3: 5i32` it would guess `I32`, and so on.

## More Integer Types {#int-types}

### Bools and Enums {#bools-and-enums}

Bools and enums are both encoded as if they were `int32`s. Bools, in particular,
always encode as either `` `00` `` or `` `01` ``. In Protoscope, `false` and
`true` are aliases for these byte strings.

### Signed Integers {#signed-ints}

As you saw in the previous section, all the protocol buffer types associated
with wire type 0 are encoded as varints. However, varints are unsigned, so the
different signed types, `sint32` and `sint64` vs `int32` or `int64`, encode
negative integers differently.

The `intN` types encode negative numbers as two's complement, which means that,
as unsigned, 64-bit integers, they have their highest bit set. As a result, this
means that *all ten bytes* must be used. For example, `-2` is converted by
protoscope into

```proto
11111110 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000001
```

This is the *two's complement* of 2, defined in unsigned arithmetic as `~0 - 2 +
1`, where `~0` is the all-ones 64-bit integer. It is a useful exercise to
understand why this produces so many ones.

On the other hand, `sintN` uses the "ZigZag" encoding instead of two's
complement to encode negative integers. Positive integers `n` are encoded as
`2 * n` (the even numbers), while negative integers `-n` are encoded as
`2 * n + 1` (the odd numbers). The encoding thus "zig-zags" between positive
and negative numbers. For example:

Signed Original | Encoded As
--------------- | ----------
0               | 0
-1              | 1
1               | 2
-2              | 3
...             | ...
0x7fffffff      | 0xfffffffe
-0x80000000     | 0xffffffff

Using some bit tricks, it's cheap to convert `n` into its ZigZag representation:

```
n + n + (n < 0)
```

Here, we assume that the boolean `n < 0` is converted into an integer 1 if true
or an integer 0 if false.

When the `sint32` or `sint64` is parsed, its value is decoded back to the
original, signed version.

In protoscope, suffixing an integer with a `z` will make it encode as ZigZag.
For example, `-500z` is the same as the varint `1001`.

### Non-varint Numbers

Non-varint numeric types are simple -- `double` and `fixed64` have wire type
`I64`, which tells the parser to expect a fixed eight-byte lump of data. We can
specify a `double` record by writing `5: 25.4`, or a `fixed64` record with `6:
200i64`. In both cases, omitting an explicit wire type infers the `I64` wire
type.

Similarly `float` and `fixed32` have wire type `I32`, which tells it to expect
four bytes instead. The syntax for these consists of adding an `i32` prefix.
`25.4i32` will emit four bytes, as will `200i32`. Tag types are inferred as
`I32`.

## Length-Delimited Records {#length-types}

*Length prefixes* are another major concept in the wire format. The `LEN` wire
type has a dynamic length, specified by a varint immediately after the tag,
which is followed by the payload as usual.

Consider this message schema:

```proto
message Test2 {
  optional string b = 2;
}
```

A record for the field `b` is a string, and strings are `LEN`-encoded. If we set
`b` to `"testing"`, we encoded as a `LEN` record with field number 2 containing
the ASCII string `"testing"`. The result is `` `120774657374696e67` ``. Breaking
up the bytes,

```proto
12 07 [74 65 73 74 69 6e 67]
```

we see that the tag, `` `12` ``, is `00010 010`, or `2:LEN`. The byte that
follows is the varint `7`, and the next seven bytes are the UTF-8 encoding of
`"testing"`.

In Protoscope, this is written as `2:LEN 7 "testing"`. However, it can be
incovenient to repeat the length of the string (which, in Protoscope text, is
already quote-delimited). Wrapping Protoscope content in braces will generate a
length prefix for it: `{"testing"}` is a shorthand for `7 "testing"`. `{}` is
always inferred by fields to be a `LEN` record, so we can write this record
simply as `2: {"testing"}`.

`bytes` fields are encoded in the same way.

### Submessages {#embedded}

Submessage fields also use the `LEN` wire type. Here's a message definition with
an embedded message of our original example message, `Test1`:

```proto
message Test3 {
  optional Test1 c = 3;
}
```

If `Test1`'s `a` field (i.e., `Test3`'s `c.a` field) is set to 150, we get `
``1a03089601`` `. Breaking it up:

```proto
 1a 03 [08 96 01]
```

The last three bytes (in `[]`) are exactly the same ones from our
[very first example](#simple). These bytes are preceded by a `LEN`-typed tag,
and a length of 3, exactly the same way as strings are encoded.

In Protoscope, submessages are quite succinct. ` ``1a03089601`` ` can be written
as `3: {1: 150}`.

## Optional and Repeated Elements {#optional}

Missing `optional` fields are easy to encode: we just leave out the record if
it's not present. This means that "huge" protos with only a few fields set are
quite sparse.

`repeated` fields are a bit more compicated. Ordinary (not [packed](#packed))
repeated fields emit one record for every element of the field. Thus, if we have

```proto
message Test4 {
  optional string d = 4;
  repeated int32 e = 5;
}
```

and we construct a `Test4` message with `d` set to `"hello"`, and `e` set to
`1`, `2`, and `3`, this *could* be encoded as `` `220568656c6c6f280128022803`
``, or written out as Protoscope,

```proto
4: {"hello"}
5: 1
5: 2
5: 3
```

However, records for `e` do not need to appear consecutively, and can be
interleaved with other fields; only the order of records for the same field with
respect to each other is preserved. Thus, this could also have been encoded as

```proto
5: 1
5: 2
4: {"hello"}
5: 3
```

There is no special treatment for `oneof`s in the wire format.

### Last One Wins {#last-one-wins}

Normally, an encoded message would never have more than one instance of a
non-`repeated` field. However, parsers are expected to handle the case in which
they do. For numeric types and strings, if the same field appears multiple
times, the parser accepts the *last* value it sees. For embedded message fields,
the parser merges multiple instances of the same field, as if with the
`Message::MergeFrom` method -- that is, all singular scalar fields in the latter
instance replace those in the former, singular embedded messages are merged, and
`repeated` fields are concatenated. The effect of these rules is that parsing
the concatenation of two encoded messages produces exactly the same result as if
you had parsed the two messages separately and merged the resulting objects.
That is, this:

```cpp
MyMessage message;
message.ParseFromString(str1 + str2);
```

is equivalent to this:

```cpp
MyMessage message, message2;
message.ParseFromString(str1);
message2.ParseFromString(str2);
message.MergeFrom(message2);
```

This property is occasionally useful, as it allows you to merge two messages (by
concatenation) even if you do not know their types.

### Packed Repeated Fields {#packed}

Starting in v2.1.0, `repeated` fields of scalar type can be declared as
"packed". In proto2 this is done with the `[packed=true]`, but in proto3 it is
the default.

Instead of being encoded as one record per entry, they are encoded as a single
`LEN` record that contains each element concatenated. To decode, elements are
decoded from the `LEN` record one by one until the payload is exhausted. The
start of the next element is determined by the length of the previous, which
itself depends on the type of the field.

For example, imagine you have the message type:

```proto
message Test5 {
  repeated int32 f = 6 [packed=true];
}
```

Now let's say you construct a `Test5`, providing the values 3, 270, and 86942
for the repeated field `f`. Encoded, this gives us `` `3206038e029ea705` ``, or
as Protoscope text,

```proto
6: {3 270 86942}
```

Only repeated fields of primitive numeric types can be declared "packed". These
are types that would normally use the `VARINT`, `I32`, or `I64` wire types.

Note that although there's usually no reason to encode more than one key-value
pair for a packed repeated field, parsers must be prepared to accept multiple
key-value pairs. In this case, the payloads should be concatenated. Each pair
must contain a whole number of elements. The following is a valid encoding of
the same message above that parsers must accept:

```proto
6: {3 270}
6: {86942}
```

Protocol buffer parsers must be able to parse repeated fields that were compiled
as `packed` as if they were not packed, and vice versa. This permits adding
`[packed=true]` to existing fields in a forward- and backward-compatible way.

### Maps

Map fields are just a shorthand for a special kind of repeated field. If we have

```proto
message Test6 {
  map<string, int32> g = 7;
}
```

this is actually the same as

```proto
message Test6 {
  message g_Entry {
    optional string key = 1;
    optional int32 value = 2;
  }
  repeated g_Entry g = 7;
}
```

Thus, maps are encoded exactly like a `repeated` message field: as a sequence of
`LEN`-typed records, with two fields each.

## Groups

Groups are a deprecated feature that should not be used, but they remain in the
wire format, and deserve a passing mention.

A group is a bit like a submessage, but it is delimited by special tags rather
than by a `LEN` prefix. Each group in a message has a field number, which is
used on these special tags.

A group with field number `8` begins with an `8:SGROUP` tag. `SGROUP` records
have empty payloads, so all this does is denote the start of the group. Once all
the fields in the group are listed, a corresponding `8:EGROUP` tag denotes its
end. `EGROUP` records also have no payload, so `8:EGROUP` is the entire record.
Group field numbers need to match up. If we encounter `7:EGROUP` where we expect
`8:EGROUP`, the message is mal-formed.

Protoscope provides a convenient syntax for writing groups. Instead of writing

```proto
8:SGROUP
  1: 2
  3: {"foo"}
8:EGROUP
```

Protoscope allows

```proto
8: !{
  1: 2
  3: {"foo"}
}
```

This will generate the appropriate start and end group markers. The `!{}` syntax
can only occur immediately after an un-typed tag expression, like `8:`.

## Field Order {#order}

Field numbers may be declared in any order in a `.proto` file. The order chosen
has no effect on how the messages are serialized.

When a message is serialized, there is no guaranteed order for how its known or
[unknown fields](/programming-guides/proto#updating) will
be written. Serialization order is an implementation detail, and the details of
any particular implementation may change in the future. Therefore, protocol
buffer parsers must be able to parse fields in any order.

### Implications

*   Do not assume the byte output of a serialized message is stable. This is
    especially true for messages with transitive bytes fields representing other
    serialized protocol buffer messages.
*   By default, repeated invocations of serialization methods on the same
    protocol buffer message instance may not produce the same byte output. That
    is, the default serialization is not deterministic.
    *   Deterministic serialization only guarantees the same byte output for a
        particular binary. The byte output may change across different versions
        of the binary.
*   The following checks may fail for a protocol buffer message instance `foo`:
    *   `foo.SerializeAsString() == foo.SerializeAsString()`
    *   `Hash(foo.SerializeAsString()) == Hash(foo.SerializeAsString())`
    *   `CRC(foo.SerializeAsString()) == CRC(foo.SerializeAsString())`
    *   `FingerPrint(foo.SerializeAsString()) ==
        FingerPrint(foo.SerializeAsString())`
*   Here are a few example scenarios where logically equivalent protocol buffer
    messages `foo` and `bar` may serialize to different byte outputs:
    *   `bar` is serialized by an old server that treats some fields as unknown.
    *   `bar` is serialized by a server that is implemented in a different
        programming language and serializes fields in different order.
    *   `bar` has a field that serializes in a non-deterministic manner.
    *   `bar` has a field that stores a serialized byte output of a protocol
        buffer message which is serialized differently.
    *   `bar` is serialized by a new server that serializes fields in a
        different order due to an implementation change.
    *   `foo` and `bar` are concatenations of the same individual messages in a
        different order.

## Condensed Reference Card {#cheat-sheet}

The following provides the most prominent parts of the wire format in an
easy-to-reference format.

```none
message    := (tag value)*

tag        := (field << 3) bit-or wire_type;
                encoded as varint
value      := varint      for wire_type == VARINT,
              i32         for wire_type == I32,
              i64         for wire_type == I64,
              len-prefix  for wire_type == LEN,
              <empty>     for wire_type == SGROUP or EGROUP

varint     := int32 | int64 | uint32 | uint64 | bool | enum | sint32 | sint64;
                encoded as varints (sintN are ZigZag-encoded first)
i32        := sfixed32 | fixed32 | float;
                encoded as 4-byte little-endian;

```

See also the
[Protoscope Language Reference](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protoscope/blob/main/language.txt).

### Key {#cheat-sheet-key}

`message   := (tag value)*`
:   A message is encoded as a sequence of zero or more pairs of tags and values.

`tag        := (field << 3) bit-or wire_type`
:   A tag is a combination of a `wire_type`, stored in the least significant
    three bits, and the field number that is defined in the `.proto` file.

`value      := varint   for wire_type == VARINT, ...`
:   A value is stored differently depending on the `wire_type` specified in the
    tag.

`varint     := int32 | int64 | uint32 | uint64 | bool | enum | sint32 | sint64`
:   You can use varint to store any of the listed data types.

`i32        := sfixed32 | fixed32 | float`
:   You can use fixed32 to store any of the listed data types.

`i64        := sfixed64 | fixed64 | double`
:   You can use fixed64 to store any of the listed data types.

`len-prefix := size (message | string | bytes | packed)`
:   A length-prefixed value is stored as a length (encoded as a varint), and
    then one of the listed data types.

`string     := valid UTF-8 string (e.g. ASCII)`
:   As described, a string must use UTF-8 character encoding. A string cannot
    exceed 2GB.

`bytes      := any sequence of 8-bit bytes`
:   As described, bytes can store custom data types, up to 2GB in size.

`packed     := varint* | i32* | i64*`
:   Use the `packed` data type when you are storing consecutive values of the
    type described in the protocol definition. The tag is dropped for values
    after the first, which amortizes the costs of tags to one per field, rather
    than per element.
