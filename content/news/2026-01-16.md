## Prebuilt proto compiler (protoc) for Bazel

In an effort to speed up builds, Bazel 9 provides an option to skip re-compiling
Protobuf tools and runtimes and use a pre-built protoc binary. Using a pre-built
protoc also avoids build failures from incompatible or non-hermetic C++
compilation toolchain installed on your machine.

To use the prebuilt protoc, you must be using Bazel 9 or later, which itself
requires protobuf version 33.4 or later. Set the
`--@protobuf//bazel/toolchains:prefer_prebuilt_protoc` flag to use the prebuilt
protoc. The default will be changed to use the prebuilt protoc with the breaking
v34 release.

### Reasons not to use the prebuilt compiler

There are some use cases in which using the prebuilt protoc is not recommended:

*   Your corporate security policy requires all dependencies be built from
    source.
*   You need to build for the exec platform with a specific compiler or specific
    compiler flags.
*   You are making changes to protoc, itself, and want to ensure that those
    changes are tested.
