## Prebuilt proto compiler (protoc) for Bazel

In an effort to speed up builds, protobuf 33.4 offers an option to skip
re-compiling Protobuf tools and runtimes and use a pre-built protoc binary,
available to Bazel 7 and later. Using a pre-built protoc also avoids build
failures from incompatible or non-hermetic C++ compilation toolchain installed
on your machine.

To use the prebuilt protoc, upgrade to protobuf version 33.4 or later, and set
the `--incompatible_enable_proto_toolchain_resolution` and
`--@protobuf//bazel/toolchains:prefer_prebuilt_protoc` flags. The first flag is
set by default in Bazel 9 onwards.

In the breaking v34 release, protobuf will change the default of
`--@protobuf//bazel/toolchains:prefer_prebuilt_protoc` to true.

### Reasons not to use the prebuilt compiler

There are some use cases in which using the prebuilt protoc is not recommended:

*   Your corporate security policy requires all dependencies be built from
    source.
*   You need to build for the exec platform with a specific compiler or specific
    compiler flags.
*   You are making changes to protoc, itself, and want to ensure that those
    changes are tested.
