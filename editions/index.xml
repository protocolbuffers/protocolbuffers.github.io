Instead of adding syntax = &amp;quot;proto2&amp;quot; or syntax = &amp;quot;proto3&amp;quot; at the top of proto definition files, you use an edition number, such as edition = &amp;quot;2023&amp;quot;, to specify the default behaviors your file will have. Editions enable the language to evolve incrementally over time.
Instead of the hardcoded behaviors that older versions have had, editions represent a collection of features with a default value (behavior) per feature.</description></item><item><title>Feature Settings for Editions</title><link>https://protobuf.dev/editions/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protobuf.dev/editions/features/</guid><description>This topic provides an overview of the features that are included in Edition 2023. Each subsequent edition&amp;rsquo;s features will be added to this topic. We announce new editions in the News section.
Before configuring feature settings in your new schema definition content, make sure you understand why you are using them. Avoid cargo-culting with features.
Prototiller Prototiller is a command-line tool that converts proto2 and proto3 definition files to Editions syntax.</description></item><item><title>Implementing Editions Support</title><link>https://protobuf.dev/editions/implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://protobuf.dev/editions/implementation/</guid><description>This topic explains how to implement editions in new runtimes and generators.
Overview Edition 2023 The first edition released is Edition 2023, which is designed to unify proto2 and proto3 syntax. The features weâ€™ve added to cover the difference in behaviors are detailed in Feature Settings for Editions.
Feature Definition In addition to supporting editions and the global features we&amp;rsquo;ve defined, you may want to define your own features to leverage the infrastructure.</description></item></channel></rss>
